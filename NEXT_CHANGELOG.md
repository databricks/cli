# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v0.295.0

### Notable Changes

- Add `bundle.engine` config setting to select the deployment engine (`terraform` or `direct`). The `DATABRICKS_BUNDLE_ENGINE` environment variable takes precedence over this setting. When the configured engine doesn't match existing deployment state, a warning is issued and the existing engine is used ([#4749](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/4749)).
