# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v1.7.0

### Notable Changes

### CLI

* An explicitly selected profile (`--profile` or a bundle's `workspace.profile`) now takes precedence over auth environment variables (`DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`, etc.) instead of being silently shadowed by them; env vars still fill auth fields the profile leaves empty ([#5096](https://github.com/databricks/cli/issues/5096)).

### Bundles

* Fix permissions added to a job or pipeline by a Python (PyDABs) mutator failing to deploy with "must have exactly one owner"; the deploying identity is now set as owner, matching resources whose permissions are declared in YAML ([#5821](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/5821)).
* Remove duplicate enum values for jsonschema.json ([#5839](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/5839)).
* Expose a computed, read-only `volume_path` on `resources.volumes.*` so configs can reference a volume's Unity Catalog path via `${resources.volumes.<key>.volume_path}` instead of hardcoding `/Volumes/<catalog>/<schema>/<name>` ([#5550](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/5550)). Derived from `catalog_name`/`schema_name`/`name` and resolved at initialize, so the reference depends on those underlying resources rather than the volume itself. Direct engine only; on Terraform it is dropped before apply and components only known after deploy are unsupported.
