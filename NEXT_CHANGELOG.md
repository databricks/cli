# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v0.299.2

### CLI

* `databricks auth describe` now reports where U2M (`databricks-cli`) tokens are stored: `plaintext` (`~/.databricks/token-cache.json`) or `secure` (OS keyring), and the source of the choice (env var, config setting, or default).
* Marked the default profile in the interactive pickers shown by `databricks auth switch`, `databricks auth logout`, `databricks auth token`, and `databricks auth login`, and moved it to the top of the list. `databricks auth login` and `databricks auth logout` now offer the same selectors as `databricks auth token` and `databricks auth switch` respectively.

### Bundles
* Make sure warnings asking for approval are understood by agents ([#5239](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/5239))
* engine/direct: Fix drift in grants resource due to privilege reordering ([#4794](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/4794))
* engine/direct: Fix 400 error when deploying grants with ALL_PRIVILEGES ([#4801](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/4801))
* Deduplicate grant entries with duplicate principals or privileges during initialization ([#4801](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/4801))
* engine/direct: Fix unwanted recreation of secret scopes when scope_backend_type is not set ([#4834](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/4834))
* engine/direct: Fix bind and unbind for non-Terraform resources ([#4850](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/4850))
* engine/direct: Fix deploying removed principals ([#4824](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/4824))
* engine/direct: Fix secret scope permissions migration from Terraform to Direct engine ([#4866](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/4866))
* Stop applying `presets.name_prefix` (and the dev-mode `[dev <user>]` rename) to `vector_search_endpoints` ([#5209](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/5209)).

* Fix `bundle generate` job to preserve nested notebook directory structure ([#4596](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/4596))
* Propagate authentication environment (including `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE`) to the `experimental.python` subprocess so bundle validate/deploy no longer fails with a multi-profile host ambiguity error when several profiles in `~/.databrickscfg` share the same host.
* Fixed `--force-pull` on `bundle summary` and `bundle open` so the flag bypasses the local state cache and reads state from the workspace.

### Dependency updates

* Bump Go toolchain to 1.25.10 ([#5213](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/5213)).
