# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v0.299.0

### CLI

* Moved file-based OAuth token cache management from the SDK to the CLI. No user-visible change; part of a three-PR sequence that makes the CLI the sole owner of its token cache.
* Added interactive pagination for list commands that have a row template (jobs, clusters, apps, pipelines, etc.). When stdin, stdout, and stderr are all TTYs, `databricks <resource> list` now streams 50 rows at a time and prompts `[space] more  [enter] all  [q|esc] quit`. ENTER can be interrupted by `q`/`esc`/`Ctrl+C` between pages. Colors and alignment match the existing non-paged output; column widths stay stable across pages. Piped output and `--output json` are unchanged.
* Added experimental OS-native secure token storage opt-in via `DATABRICKS_AUTH_STORAGE=secure`. Legacy file-backed token storage remains the default.


### Bundles

### Dependency updates

* Added `github.com/zalando/go-keyring` as a new dependency (dormant until a later release enables experimental secure-storage for OAuth tokens).
