Guidance for Working with This Project
======================================

Below is guidance for how to work with this project. Note that most interactions
are done with the Databricks CLI; see 'databricks bundle --help' for more information.

Use 'databricks bundle generate' to add new resources to the project.

Note that Databricks resources are defined in resources/*.yml files.
See https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/settings for a reference!

Getting Started
---------------

1. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace (if you have not done so already):
   $ databricks auth login

2. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev

   (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the --target parameter is optional here.)

   This deploys everything that's defined for this project. For example, the default
   template would deploy a job to your workspace. You can find that job by opening
   your workspace and clicking on **Workflows**.

3. Similarly, to deploy a production copy, type:
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target prod

4. To run a job, use the "run" command:
   $ databricks bundle run

5. Optionally, install developer tools such as the Databricks extension for Visual
   Studio Code from:
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/vscode-ext.html
