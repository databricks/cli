# Agent instructions

This file can be used for any project-specific instructions!

## Prerequisites

If the Databricks CLI MCP server is not yet installed, install it by:
1. Installing the Databricks CLI: https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/install
2. Running: `databricks experimental mcp install`

## Working with this project

General agent guidance: always use the mcp__databricks-mcp__analyze_project tool whenever you open this project!
It makes sure you have more context on the current project and what actions you can perform on it.

{{if .ProjectName}}
## Project Initialization

Project '{{.ProjectName}}' initialized successfully at: {{.ProjectPath}}

⚠️  IMPORTANT: This is an EMPTY project with NO resources (no apps, jobs, pipelines, or dashboards)!

If the user asked you to create a specific resource (like "create an app" or "create a job"), you MUST now call the add_project_resource tool to add it!

Example: add_project_resource(project_path="{{.ProjectPath}}", type="app", name="my_app", template="nodejs-fastapi-hello-world-app")
{{end}}
