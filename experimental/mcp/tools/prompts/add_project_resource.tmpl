IMPORTANT: This is just a starting point! You need to iterate over the generated files to complete the setup.

{{if .AnalyzeError}}
NOTE: Resource scaffolding succeeded, but project analysis failed: {{.AnalyzeError}}

You can still work with the project. Use the analyze_project tool separately to get detailed guidance, or proceed with these basic guidelines:

IMPORTANT: Most interactions are done with the Databricks CLI. YOU (the AI) must use the invoke_databricks_cli tool to run commands - never suggest the user runs CLI commands directly!
IMPORTANT: To add new resources to a project, use the 'add_project_resource' MCP tool. You can add:
  - Apps (interactive applications)
  - Jobs (Python or SQL workflows)
  - Pipelines (Python or SQL data pipelines)
  - Dashboards (data visualizations)
MANDATORY: Always deploy with invoke_databricks_cli 'bundle deploy', never with 'apps deploy'

Note that Databricks resources are defined in resources/*.yml files. See https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/settings for a reference!
