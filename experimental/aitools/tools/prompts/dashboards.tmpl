Working with Dashboards
------------------------
- Dashboards are data visualizations built with Databricks SQL
- Dashboard definitions are in src/*.lvdash.json files
- Preview dashboards after deployment using: invoke_databricks_cli(command="bundle open <dashboard_name>", working_directory="<project_path>")
- Deploy dashboards using: invoke_databricks_cli(command="bundle deploy --target dev", working_directory="<project_path>")
