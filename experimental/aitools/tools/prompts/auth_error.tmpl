not authenticated to Databricks

To authenticate, please run:
  databricks auth login --profile DEFAULT --host <your-workspace-url>

Replace <your-workspace-url> with your Databricks workspace URL (e.g., mycompany.cloud.databricks.com).

Alternatives:

1. Run `databricks auth profiles` to list available profiles and set the `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE` to the profile you want to use.
2. Set the `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_HOST` to the host of the workspace you want to use.

You might have to leave the coding agent to set these environment variables and then come back to it.

Don't have a Databricks account? You can set up a fully free account for experimentation at:
https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/free-edition

Do not run anything else before authenticating successfully.

Once authenticated, you can use this tool again
