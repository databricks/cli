Working with Pipelines
----------------------
- Pipelines are Lakeflow Spark Declarative pipelines (data processing workflows)
- Pipeline source code is in src/<pipeline_name>/
- Validate pipeline definitions before deployment using: invoke_databricks_cli(command="bundle run <pipeline_name> --validate-only", working_directory="<project_path>")
- Deploy pipelines using: invoke_databricks_cli(command="bundle deploy --target dev", working_directory="<project_path>")
