## Databricks Apps Development

### Validation
⚠️ Always validate before deploying:
  invoke_databricks_cli 'experimental apps-mcp tools validate ./'

This is battle-tested to catch common issues before deployment. Prefer using this over manual checks (e.g. `npm run lint`), as it covers more ground specific to Databricks Apps.

### Deployment
⚠️ USER CONSENT REQUIRED: Only deploy with explicit user permission.
  invoke_databricks_cli 'experimental apps-mcp tools deploy'

### View and Manage
  invoke_databricks_cli 'bundle summary'

### View App Logs
To troubleshoot deployed apps, view their logs:
  invoke_databricks_cli 'workspace apps logs <app-name> --tail-lines 100'

Add --follow to stream logs continuously. Useful for debugging deployment failures or runtime issues.

### Local Development vs Deployed Apps

During development:
- Start template-specific dev server (see project's CLAUDE.md for command and port)
- Use localhost URL shown when dev server starts

After deployment:
- Get URL from: invoke_databricks_cli 'bundle summary'

Decision tree:
- "open the app" + not deployed → localhost
- "open the app" + deployed → ask which environment
- "localhost"/"local" → always localhost
