Your session in Databricks MCP has been successfully initialized.

## Available Tools:
- **explore**: Discover workspace resources, get CLI command examples, and workflow recommendations
- **invoke_databricks_cli**: Execute any Databricks CLI command (bundle, apps, workspace, etc.)

## Workflow Best Practices:
- Use `explore` at the start of tasks to understand workspace context and get relevant commands
- Use `invoke_databricks_cli` for all Databricks CLI operations (better for tracking and allowlisting)
- For Databricks Asset Bundles: Use `invoke_databricks_cli 'bundle validate'` before deploying
- Always validate before deploying to ensure configuration is correct
- When not sure about the user's intent, ask clarifying questions before proceeding
- Do NOT create summary files, reports, or README unless explicitly requested
