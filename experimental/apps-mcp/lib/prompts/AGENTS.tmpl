# Databricks Asset Bundles Project

This project uses Databricks Asset Bundles for deployment. Add project-specific instructions below.

## For AI Agents: MANDATORY First Action

**BEFORE any other action, call `mcp__databricks-mcp__databricks_discover` with this project's path.**

This is required because the discover tool:
- Detects project state (new, deployed, running) and provides relevant guidance
- Shows available CLI commands and recommended next steps
- Configures workspace authentication

Without this context, you cannot effectively help with this project.

If the tool is unavailable, the user needs to set up the Databricks CLI MCP server:
1. Install CLI: https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/install
2. Run: `databricks experimental apps-mcp install`
