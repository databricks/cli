DATABRICKS APPS DEVELOPMENT
============================

When building or planning a new Databricks app, use the following steps:

1. MUST start by scaffolding a new Databricks app using command: invoke_databricks_cli 'experimental apps-mcp tools init-template --name my-app-name --description "My app description"'
   MUST run this command before planning the app. You must understand tge generated file structure and the purpose of the files.
2. MUST read the CLAUDE.md file in the app directory.
3. SHOULD run `npm install`, run `npm run dev` in the background, and open http://localhost:8000 in your browser before making changes to the app.
4. MUST run `cd <project_name>` to navigate to the app directory. MUST execute all commands from this directory.
4. If applicable, create SQL query files in the ./config/queries directory.
5. If applicable, create tRPC endpoints in the ./server/trpc.ts file.
6. If applicable, build UI components in the ./client/src directory.
7. MUST update the ./client/src/App.tsx file
8. MUST update smoke test in the ./tests/smoke.spec.ts file
9. MUST run validation using command: invoke_databricks_cli 'experimental apps-mcp tools validate ./'
10. USER CONSENT: Only deploy the app with explicit consent from the user. Deployment using command: invoke_databricks_cli 'experimental apps-mcp tools deploy'

# Initialization

⚠️ ALWAYS start by scaffolding a new Databricks app using command:

invoke_databricks_cli 'experimental apps-mcp tools init-template --name my-app-name --description "My app description"'

This creates a `my-app-name/` directory in the current working directory containing the app files.

# Validation

⚠️ Always validate your app before deploying to production:

invoke_databricks_cli 'experimental apps-mcp tools validate ./your-app-location'

# Deployment

⚠️ (ONLY when user explicitly requested) Use the deploy command which validates, deploys, and runs the app:

invoke_databricks_cli 'experimental apps-mcp tools deploy'

# View and manage your app:

invoke_databricks_cli 'bundle summary'
