DATABRICKS APPS DEVELOPMENT
============================

# Initialization

⚠️ MUST start by scaffolding a new Databricks app:

invoke_databricks_cli 'experimental apps-mcp tools init-template --name my-app-name --description "My app description"'

After scaffolding:
1. MUST read CLAUDE.md in the app directory for template-specific instructions
2. MUST run `cd <project_name>` to navigate to the app directory
3. MUST execute all subsequent commands from this directory

# Local Development

⚠️ After initialization, check the app's CLAUDE.md for:
- How to run the app locally
- Development commands specific to the template
- Local vs deployed environment guidance

# Validation

⚠️ Before deploying, validate your app:

invoke_databricks_cli 'experimental apps-mcp tools validate ./your-app-location'

This ensures the app is production-ready by running template-specific checks.

# Deployment

⚠️ CRITICAL: NEVER deploy without explicit user confirmation!

Before deploying:
1. ✅ Validate the app successfully
2. ✅ Test locally per CLAUDE.md instructions
3. ✅ Ask user: "Ready to deploy to [environment]?"

Once confirmed:

invoke_databricks_cli 'experimental apps-mcp tools deploy'

After deployment:

invoke_databricks_cli 'bundle summary'
