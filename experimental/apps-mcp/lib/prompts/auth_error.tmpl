Not authenticated to Databricks

I need to know either the Databricks workspace URL or the Databricks profile name.
You can list the available profiles by running `databricks auth profiles`.

ASK the user which of the configured profiles or databricks workspace URL they want to use.
Only then call the `databricks_configure_auth` tool to configure the authentication.

Do not run anything else before authenticating successfully.
Once authenticated, you can use this tool again
