Not authenticated to Databricks

I need to know either the Databricks workspace URL or the Databricks profile name.
You can list the available profiles by running `databricks auth profiles`.

Please configure your authentication using one of these methods:
1. Set environment variables: DATABRICKS_HOST and DATABRICKS_TOKEN
2. Use Databricks CLI profiles: Set DATABRICKS_PROFILE or use the default profile
3. Provide authentication details in your MCP client configuration

Once authenticated, you can use this tool again
