# databricks-bundles

Python for Databricks Asset Bundles extends [Databricks Asset Bundles](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/) so that you can:
- Define jobs and pipelines as Python code. These jobs can coexist with jobs defined in YAML.
- Dynamically create jobs and pipelines using metadata.
- Modify jobs and pipelines defined in YAML or Python during bundle deployment.

Documentation is available at https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html.
