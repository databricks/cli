# List of test cases that will not cause integration test to fail.
# The test will be still run but failure is silented. See tools/testrunner on main branch.
#
# Format is two words: package testname
#
# Each can be replaced by "*" (without quotes to match everything)
# * TestAccept/selftest/basic  # matches this test name across any package
# libs/telemetry *             # matches all test cases inside libs/telemetry package
#
# The above examples are non-recursive. If package name or test name ends with a /, it acts as a prefix:
# acceptance TestAccept/bundle/resources/jobs/  # jobs undergoing maintenance
#

# Error: Invalid access token. [ReqId: [UUID]] on aws-prod, but not on aws-prod-ucws
# Cannot reproduce it locally though - works for me via "deco env run -i -n aws-prod"

# SSH test is flaky due to concurrent test suites (Linux/Windows) running on same cluster.
# Current implementation uses cluster-id as server identifier, causing SIGTERM conflicts.
# Fix exists in serverless connection mode (not yet merged).
