# List of test cases that will not cause integration test to fail.
# The test will be still run but failure is silented. See tools/testrunner on main branch.
#
# Format is two words: package testname
#
# Each can be replaced by "*" (without quotes to match everything)
# * TestAccept/selftest/basic  # matches this test name across any package
# libs/telemetry *             # matches all test cases inside libs/telemetry package
#
# The above examples are non-recursive. If package name or test name ends with a /, it acts as a prefix:
# acceptance TestAccept/bundle/resources/jobs/  # jobs undergoing maintenance
#

# This test is consistently failing in nightlies timing out when trying to stop an app (Oct 16 2025):
acceptance TestAccept/bundle/run/app-with-job/DATABRICKS_BUNDLE_ENGINE=direct-exp
acceptance TestAccept/bundle/run/app-with-job/DATABRICKS_BUNDLE_ENGINE=terraform

# Runaway creation of pipelines for online tables in Azure
acceptance TestAccept/bundle/resources/synced_database_tables/basic
