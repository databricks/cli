If it is not included, CAN_MANAGE permissions are only applied if the present identity is used to deploy.

Consider using a adding a top-level permissions section such as the following:

  permissions:

Success! Migrated 2 resources to direct engine state file: [TEST_TMP_DIR]/.databricks/bundle/production/resources.json

Validate the migration by running "databricks bundle plan", there should be no actions planned.

The state file is not synchronized to the workspace yet. To do that and finalize the migration, run "bundle deploy".

To undo the migration, remove [TEST_TMP_DIR]/.databricks/bundle/production/resources.json and rename [TEST_TMP_DIR]/.databricks/bundle/production/terraform/terraform.tfstate.backup to [TEST_TMP_DIR]/.databricks/bundle/production/terraform/terraform.tfstate
