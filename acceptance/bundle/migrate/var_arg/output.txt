Note: Migration should be done after a full deploy. Running plan now to verify that deployment was done:
Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to delete, 1 unchanged
Success! Migrated 1 resources to direct engine state file: [TEST_TMP_DIR]/.databricks/bundle/dev/resources.json

Validate the migration by running "databricks bundle plan --var 'job_name=Custom Job Name'", there should be no actions planned.

The state file is not synchronized to the workspace yet. To do that and finalize the migration, run "bundle deploy --var 'job_name=Custom Job Name'".

To undo the migration, remove [TEST_TMP_DIR]/.databricks/bundle/dev/resources.json and rename [TEST_TMP_DIR]/.databricks/bundle/dev/terraform/terraform.tfstate.backup to [TEST_TMP_DIR]/.databricks/bundle/dev/terraform/terraform.tfstate
