Recommendation: permissions section should explicitly include the current deployment identity '[USERNAME]' or one of its groups
If it is not included, CAN_MANAGE permissions are only applied if the present identity is used to deploy.

Consider using a adding a top-level permissions section such as the following:

  permissions:
    - user_name: [USERNAME]
      level: CAN_MANAGE

See https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/permissions.html to learn more about permission configuration.
