This action will result in the deletion or recreation of the following Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines along with the
Streaming Tables (STs) and Materialized Views (MVs) managed by them. Recreating the pipelines will
restore the defined STs and MVs through full refresh. Note that recreation is necessary when pipeline
properties such as the 'catalog' or 'storage' are changed:
