Error: Invalid max_retries configuration for for_each_task
  at resources.jobs.test_job.tasks[0]
  in databricks.yml:9:11

Task "parent_task" has max_retries defined at the parent level, but it uses for_each_task.
When using for_each_task, max_retries must be defined on the nested task (for_each_task.task.max_retries), not on the parent task.
