Warning: You are using the legacy mode of run_as. The support for this mode is experimental and might be removed in a future release of the CLI. In order to run the DLT pipelines in your DAB as the run_as user this mode changes the owners of the pipelines to the run_as identity, which requires the user deploying the bundle to be a workspace admin, and also a Metastore admin if the pipeline target is in UC.
