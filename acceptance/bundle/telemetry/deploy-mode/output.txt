>>> [CLI] bundle deploy -t prod
Recommendation: target with 'mode: production' should set 'workspace.root_path' to make sure only one copy is deployed

A common practice is to use a username or principal name in this path, i.e. use

  root_path: /Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/.bundle/${bundle.name}/${bundle.target}

Uploading bundle files to /Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/.bundle/test-bundle/prod/files...
Deploying resources...
Deployment complete!
