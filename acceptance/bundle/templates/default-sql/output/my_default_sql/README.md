# my_default_sql

The 'my_default_sql' project was generated by using the default-sql template.

## Getting started

1. Install the Databricks CLI from https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/install.html

2. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace (if you have not done so already):
    ```
    $ databricks configure
    ```

3. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:
    ```
    $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
    ```
    (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
    is optional here.)

    This deploys everything that's defined for this project.
    For example, the default template would deploy a job called
    `[dev yourname] my_default_sql_job` to your workspace.
    You can find that job by opening your workpace and clicking on **Workflows**.

4. Similarly, to deploy a production copy, type:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target prod
   ```

5. To run a job, use the "run" command:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle run
   ```

6. Optionally, install developer tools such as the Databricks extension for Visual Studio Code from
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/vscode-ext.html.

7. For documentation on the Databricks Asset Bundles format used
   for this project, and for CI/CD configuration, see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/index.html.
