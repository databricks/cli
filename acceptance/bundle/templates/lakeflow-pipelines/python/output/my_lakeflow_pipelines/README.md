The 'my_lakeflow_pipelines' project was generated by using the Lakeflow Pipelines template.

* `src/`: Python source code for this project.
* `resources/`:  Resource configurations (jobs, pipelines, etc.)

## Getting started

Choose how you want to work on this project:

(a) Directly in your Databricks workspace, see
    https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/workspace.

(b) Locally with an IDE like Cursor or VS Code, see
    https://docs.databricks.com/vscode-ext.

(c) With command line tools, see https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html

# Using this project using the CLI

The Databricks workspace and IDE extensions provide a graphical interface for working
with this project. It's also possible to interact with it directly using the CLI:

1. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace, if you have not done so already:
    ```
    $ databricks configure
    ```

2. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:
    ```
    $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
    ```
    (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
    is optional here.)

    This deploys everything that's defined for this project.
    For example, the default template would deploy a pipeline called
    `[dev yourname] lakeflow_pipelines_etl` to your workspace.
    You can find that resource by opening your workpace and clicking on **Jobs & Pipelines**.

3. Similarly, to deploy a production copy, type:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target prod
   ```
   Note the default template has a includes a job that runs the pipeline every day
   (defined in resources/lakeflow_pipelines_etl/lakeflow_pipelines_job.job.yml). The schedule
   is paused when deploying in development mode (see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/deployment-modes.html).

4. To run a job or pipeline, use the "run" command:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle run
   ```
