# my_default_python

The 'my_default_python' project was generated by using the default-python template.

For documentation on the Databricks asset bundles format use for this project,
and for CI/CD configuration, see https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles.

## Getting started

Choose how you want to work on this project:

(a) Directly in your Databricks workspace, see
    https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/workspace.

(b) Locally with an IDE like Cursor, VS Code, or PyCharm, see
    https://docs.databricks.com/vscode-ext and https://www.databricks.com/blog/announcing-pycharm-integration-databricks.

(c) With command line tools, see https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html
Dependencies for this project should be installed using UV:

*  Make sure you have the UV package manager installed.
   It's an alternative to tools like pip: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/.
*  Run `uv sync --dev` to install the project's dependencies.

# Using this project using the CLI

The Databricks workspace and IDE extensions provide a graphical interface for working
with this project. It's also possible to interact with it directly using the CLI:

1. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace, if you have not done so already:
    ```
    $ databricks configure
    ```

2. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:
    ```
    $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
    ```
    (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
    is optional here.)

    This deploys everything that's defined for this project.
    For example, the default template would deploy a job called
    `[dev yourname] my_default_python_job` to your workspace.
    You can find that job by opening your workpace and clicking on **Jobs & Pipelines**.

3. Similarly, to deploy a production copy, type:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target prod
   ```

   Note that the default job from the template has a schedule that runs every day
   (defined in resources/my_default_python.job.yml). The schedule
   is paused when deploying in development mode (see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/deployment-modes.html).

4. To run a job or pipeline, use the "run" command:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle run
   ```

5. Finally, to run tests locally, use `pytest`:
   ```
   $ uv run pytest
   ```
