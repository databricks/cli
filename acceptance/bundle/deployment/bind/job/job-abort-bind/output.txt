=== Create a pre-defined job:
Created job with ID: [NUMID]

=== Expect binding to fail without an auto-approve flag:
Error: This bind operation requires user confirmation, but the current console does not support prompting. Please specify --auto-approve if you would like to skip prompts and proceed.

=== Deploy bundle:
>>> [CLI] bundle deploy --force-lock
Uploading bundle files to /Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/.bundle/test-bind-job-[UNIQUE_NAME]/files...
Deploying resources...
Updating deployment state...
Deployment complete!

=== Check that job is not bound and not updated with config from bundle:
>>> [CLI] jobs get [NUMID]
{
  "job_id": [NUMID],
  "settings": {
    "name": "test-unbound-job-[UNIQUE_NAME]",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "task_key": "my_notebook_task",
        "spark_python_task": {
          "python_file": "/Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/initial_hello_world.py"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
