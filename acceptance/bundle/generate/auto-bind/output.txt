Created job with ID: [NUMID]

>>> [CLI] workspace mkdirs /Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/python-[UNIQUE_NAME]

>>> [CLI] workspace import /Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/python-[UNIQUE_NAME]/test --file test.py --language PYTHON

=== Generate and bind in one step:
>>> [CLI] bundle generate job --key test_job --existing-job-id [NUMID] --config-dir resources --source-dir src --bind
File successfully saved to src/test.py
Job configuration successfully saved to resources/test_job.job.yml
