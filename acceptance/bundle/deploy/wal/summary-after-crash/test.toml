# Bundle summary should show resources recovered from WAL after a real crash.
# job_b depends on job_a, so after job_a is created and SaveState is called,
# refreshRemoteState calls jobs/get to fetch job_a's state for job_b's reference.
# We kill on jobs/get - AFTER job_a's SaveState, so WAL contains job_a.
