# WAL recovery after crash during delete operation (simulated).
# Delete was recorded in WAL but not finalized. Deploy should complete the delete.
# Note: Real crash testing for delete is not possible because there's no API call
# after DeleteState (unlike create which has refreshRemoteState after SaveState).

# No server stubs needed - the delete was already done (recorded in WAL)
# and the job no longer needs API calls
