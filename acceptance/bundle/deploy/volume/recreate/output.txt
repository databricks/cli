=== Recreation of the volume without --auto-approve should fail since prompting is not possible
>>> errcode [CLI] bundle deploy --var=schema_name=${resources.schemas.schema2.name}
Uploading bundle files to /Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/.bundle/test-uc-volumes-[UNIQUE_NAME]/default/files...

This action will result in the deletion or recreation of the following volumes.
For managed volumes, the files stored in the volume are also deleted from your
cloud tenant within 30 days. For external volumes, the metadata about the volume
is removed from the catalog, but the underlying files are not deleted:
  recreate volume foo
Error: the deployment requires destructive actions, but current console does not support prompting. Please specify --auto-approve if you would like to skip prompts and proceed


Exit code: 1
