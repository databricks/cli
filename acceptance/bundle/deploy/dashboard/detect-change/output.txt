=== Assert that the dashboard exists at the expected path and is, indeed, a dashboard:
>>> [CLI] workspace get-status /Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/.bundle/[UNIQUE_NAME]/resources/test-dashboard-[UNIQUE_NAME].lvdash.json
{
  "object_type": "DASHBOARD",
  "path": "/Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/.bundle/[UNIQUE_NAME]/resources/test-dashboard-[UNIQUE_NAME].lvdash.json"
}

=== Load the dashboard by its ID and confirm its display name: {
  "display_name": "test-dashboard-[UNIQUE_NAME]",
  "serialized_dashboard": "{\"pages\":[{\"name\":\"fdd21a3c\",\"displayName\":\"New Page\",\"layout\":[{\"widget\":{\"name\":\"82eb9107\",\"textbox_spec\":\"# I'm a title\"},\"position\":{\"x\":0,\"y\":0,\"width\":6,\"height\":2}},{\"widget\":{\"name\":\"ffa6de4f\",\"textbox_spec\":\"Text\"},\"position\":{\"x\":0,\"y\":2,\"width\":6,\"height\":2}}],\"pageType\":\"PAGE_TYPE_CANVAS\"}]}"
}

=== Make an out of band modification to the dashboard and confirm that it is detected:
{
  "lifecycle_state": "ACTIVE"
}

=== Try to redeploy the bundle and confirm that the out of band modification is detected:
>>> errcode [CLI] bundle deploy
Error: dashboard "file_reference" has been modified remotely
  at resources.dashboards.file_reference
  in databricks.yml:10:7

This dashboard has been modified remotely since the last bundle deployment.
These modifications are untracked and will be overwritten on deploy.

Make sure that the local dashboard definition matches what you intend to deploy
before proceeding with the deployment.

Run `databricks bundle deploy --force` to bypass this error.


Exit code: 1

=== Redeploy the bundle with the --force flag and confirm that the out of band modification is ignored:
>>> errcode [CLI] bundle deploy --force
Uploading bundle files to /Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/.bundle/[UNIQUE_NAME]/files...

>>> [CLI] bundle destroy --auto-approve
The following resources will be deleted:
  delete dashboard file_reference

All files and directories at the following location will be deleted: /Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/.bundle/[UNIQUE_NAME]
