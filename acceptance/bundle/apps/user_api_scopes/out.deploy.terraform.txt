Error: terraform apply: exit status 1

Error: Provider produced inconsistent result after apply

When applying changes to databricks_app.reporting_app, provider
"provider[\"registry.terraform.io/databricks/databricks\"]" produced an
unexpected new value: .user_api_scopes: was
cty.ListVal([]cty.Value{cty.StringVal("sql")}), but now null.

This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own
issue tracker.
