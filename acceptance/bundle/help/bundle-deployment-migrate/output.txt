>>> [CLI] bundle deployment migrate --help
Migrate bundle resources from Terraform deployment to Direct deployment.

This command converts your bundle from using Terraform for deployment to using
the Direct deployment engine. It reads resource IDs from the existing Terraform
state and creates a Direct deployment state file (resources.json) with the same
lineage and incremented serial number.

The command will:
1. Read the current Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate)
2. Extract resource IDs and lineage information
3. Create a Direct deployment state file (resources.json)
4. Preserve the same lineage with serial number incremented by 1

After migration:
- The CLI will automatically detect and use Direct deployment based on the
  presence of resources.json
- Use 'bundle deploy' as usual - it will use Direct deployment engine
- Your existing resources will be managed through Direct deployment

WARNING: After migration, don't switch back to Terraform deployment without
proper state management as it may cause resource conflicts.
