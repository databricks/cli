>>> [CLI] bundle deployment migrate --help
This command converts your bundle from using Terraform for deployment to using
the Direct deployment engine. It reads resource IDs from the existing Terraform
state and creates a Direct deployment state file (resources.json) with the same
lineage and incremented serial number.

Note, the migration is performed locally only. To finalize it, run 'bundle deploy'. This will synchronize the state file
to the workspace so that subsequent deploys of this bundle use direct deployment engine as well.

WARNING: Both direct deployment engine and this command are experimental and not recommended for production targets yet.
