# Installing wheels from Workspace file system is only supported starting from DBR 13.1+.
# But before users used older DBRs and python wheel tasks but installed it from DBFS.
# We still want to support older DBRs and did the trampoline workaround (https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/635)
# Hence this is to test that python wheel tasks in DABs are working for older DBRs
