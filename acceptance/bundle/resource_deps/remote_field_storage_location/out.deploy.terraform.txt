Error: terraform apply: exit status 1

Error: Provider produced inconsistent final plan

When expanding the plan for databricks_volume.foo to include new values
learned so far during apply, provider
"registry.terraform.io/databricks/databricks" produced an invalid new value
for .comment: was null, but now
cty.StringVal("s3://deco-uc-prod-isolated-aws-us-east-1/metastore/[UUID]/volumes/[UUID]").

This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own
issue tracker.
