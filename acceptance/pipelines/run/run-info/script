title "Run pipeline and display pipeline configuration summary and events durations"
# Test note: The mock API handler for "GET /api/2.0/pipelines/{pipeline_id}/events" doesn't support
# the OrderBy query parameter. In production, the real API returns events in descending order (newest first), and
# bundle/run/pipeline.go reverses them again to display chronologically.
# So, test output appears "backwards" compared to production behavior.
