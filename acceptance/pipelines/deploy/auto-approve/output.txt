The following UC schemas will be deleted or recreated. Any underlying data may be lost:
  delete schema bar

This action will result in the deletion or recreation of the following DLT Pipelines along with the
Streaming Tables (STs) and Materialized Views (MVs) managed by them. Recreating the Pipelines will
restore the defined STs and MVs through full refresh. Note that recreation is necessary when pipeline
properties such as the 'catalog' or 'storage' are changed:
  delete pipeline foo
Error: the deployment requires destructive actions, but current console does not support prompting. Please specify --auto-approve if you would like to skip prompts and proceed


Exit code: 1
