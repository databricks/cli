=== Fail to deploy OSS Spark pipelines-formatted YAML file
>>> musterr [PIPELINES] deploy
Warning: unknown field: definitions
  in oss-pipeline.yml:1:1

Error: oss-pipeline.yml seems to be formatted for open-source Spark Declarative Pipelines.
Pipelines CLI currently only supports Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines development.
To see an example of a supported pipelines template, create a new Pipelines CLI project with "pipelines init".

Exit code (musterr): 1
