Welcome to the template for pipelines!


Your new project has been created in the 'my_project' directory!

Refer to the README.md file for "getting started" instructions!

=== Deploy pipeline
>>> [PIPELINES] deploy
Uploading bundle files to /Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/.bundle/my_project/dev/files...
Deploying resources...
Updating deployment state...
Deployment complete!

=== Run pipeline
>>> [PIPELINES] run
Update URL: [DATABRICKS_URL]/#joblist/pipelines/[UUID]/updates/[UUID]

Update ID: [UUID]

=== Edit project by creating and running a new second pipeline
>>> [PIPELINES] deploy
Uploading bundle files to /Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/.bundle/my_project/dev/files...
Deploying resources...
Updating deployment state...
Deployment complete!

=== Assert the second pipeline is created
>>> [CLI] pipelines get [UUID]
{
  "creator_user_name":"[USERNAME]",
  "last_modified":[UNIX_TIME_MILLIS],
  "name":"[dev [USERNAME]] my_project_pipeline_2",
  "pipeline_id":"[UUID]",
  "run_as_user_name":"[USERNAME]",
  "spec": {
    "channel":"CURRENT",
    "deployment": {
      "kind":"BUNDLE",
      "metadata_file_path":"/Workspace/Users/[USERNAME]/.bundle/my_project/dev/state/metadata.json"
    },
    "development":true,
    "edition":"ADVANCED",
    "id":"[UUID]",
    "name":"[dev [USERNAME]] my_project_pipeline_2",
    "storage":"dbfs:/pipelines/[UUID]"
  },
  "state":"IDLE"
}

>>> [PIPELINES] run my_project_pipeline_2
Update URL: [DATABRICKS_URL]/#joblist/pipelines/[UUID]/updates/[UUID]

Update ID: [UUID]

=== Stop both pipelines before destroy
>>> [PIPELINES] stop my_project_pipeline
Stopping my_project_pipeline...
my_project_pipeline has been stopped.

>>> [PIPELINES] stop my_project_pipeline_2
Stopping my_project_pipeline_2...
