The Secrets API allows you to manage secrets, secret scopes, and access
  permissions.

  Sometimes accessing data requires that you authenticate to external data
  sources through JDBC. Instead of directly entering your credentials into a
  notebook, use Databricks secrets to store your credentials and reference them
  in notebooks and jobs.

  Administrators, secret creators, and users granted permission can read
  Databricks secrets. While Databricks makes an effort to redact secret values
  that might be displayed in notebooks, it is not possible to prevent such users
  from reading secrets.

  databricks secrets [flags]
  databricks secrets [command]
