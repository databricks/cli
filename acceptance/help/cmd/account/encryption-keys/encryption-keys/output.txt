>>> $CLI account encryption-keys create --help
Create encryption key configuration.
  
  Creates a customer-managed key configuration object for an account, specified
  by ID. This operation uploads a reference to a customer-managed key to
  Databricks. If the key is assigned as a workspace's customer-managed key for
  managed services, Databricks uses the key to encrypt the workspaces notebooks
  and secrets in the control plane, in addition to Databricks SQL queries and
  query history. If it is specified as a workspace's customer-managed key for
  workspace storage, the key encrypts the workspace's root S3 bucket (which
  contains the workspace's root DBFS and system data) and, optionally, cluster
  EBS volume data.
  
  **Important**: Customer-managed keys are supported only for some deployment
  types, subscription types, and AWS regions that currently support creation of
  Databricks workspaces.
  
  This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of the
  platform or on a select custom plan that allows multiple workspaces per
  account.

>>> $CLI account encryption-keys get --help
Get encryption key configuration.
  
  Gets a customer-managed key configuration object for an account, specified by
  ID. This operation uploads a reference to a customer-managed key to
  Databricks. If assigned as a workspace's customer-managed key for managed
  services, Databricks uses the key to encrypt the workspaces notebooks and
  secrets in the control plane, in addition to Databricks SQL queries and query
  history. If it is specified as a workspace's customer-managed key for storage,

>>> $CLI account encryption-keys list --help
Get all encryption key configurations.
  
  Gets all customer-managed key configuration objects for an account. If the key
  is specified as a workspace's managed services customer-managed key,
  Databricks uses the key to encrypt the workspace's notebooks and secrets in
  the control plane, in addition to Databricks SQL queries and query history. If
  the key is specified as a workspace's storage customer-managed key, the key is
  used to encrypt the workspace's root S3 bucket and optionally can encrypt
  cluster EBS volumes data in the data plane.
  
  **Important**: Customer-managed keys are supported only for some deployment
  types, subscription types, and AWS regions.
  
  This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of the
  platform.
