>>> $CLI account access-control get-assignable-roles-for-resource --help
Get assignable roles for a resource.
  
  Gets all the roles that can be granted on an account level resource. A role is
  grantable if the rule set on the resource can contain an access rule of the
  role.

  Arguments:
    RESOURCE: The resource name for which assignable roles will be listed.

Usage:
  databricks account access-control get-assignable-roles-for-resource RESOURCE [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for get-assignable-roles-for-resource

Global Flags:
      --debug            enable debug logging
  -o, --output type      output type: text or json (default text)
  -p, --profile string   ~/.databrickscfg profile
  -t, --target string    bundle target to use (if applicable)

>>> $CLI account access-control get-rule-set --help
Get a rule set.
  
  Get a rule set by its name. A rule set is always attached to a resource and
  contains a list of access rules on the said resource. Currently only a default
  rule set for each resource is supported.

  Arguments:
    NAME: The ruleset name associated with the request.
    ETAG: Etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag
      provided. Etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a rule set from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read ->
      modify -> write pattern to perform rule set updates in order to avoid race
      conditions that is get an etag from a GET rule set request, and pass it
      with the PUT update request to identify the rule set version you are
      updating.

Usage:
  databricks account access-control get-rule-set NAME ETAG [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for get-rule-set

Global Flags:
      --debug            enable debug logging
  -o, --output type      output type: text or json (default text)
  -p, --profile string   ~/.databrickscfg profile
  -t, --target string    bundle target to use (if applicable)

>>> $CLI account access-control update-rule-set --help
Update a rule set.
  
  Replace the rules of a rule set. First, use get to read the current version of
  the rule set before modifying it. This pattern helps prevent conflicts between
  concurrent updates.

Usage:
  databricks account access-control update-rule-set [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help        help for update-rule-set
      --json JSON   either inline JSON string or @path/to/file.json with request body (default JSON (0 bytes))

Global Flags:
      --debug            enable debug logging
  -o, --output type      output type: text or json (default text)
  -p, --profile string   ~/.databrickscfg profile
  -t, --target string    bundle target to use (if applicable)
