# MSYS2 automatically converts absolute paths like /Users/$username/$UNIQUE_NAME to
# C:/Program Files/Git/Users/$username/UNIQUE_NAME before passing it to the CLI
# Setting this environment variable prevents that conversion on windows.
# This is fine to do for all tests because:
# 1. In most contexts an absolute path refers to a file in a Databricks workspace.
# 2. Most if not all tests will use relative paths for local files.
