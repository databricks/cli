# We should always treat new lines in text files acceptance tests in windows as \n.
# This is important because the characters itself can be semantically important in tests.
# For example, an additional \r character in windows changes the upload payload if you are
# uploading the file's content to a workspace.
*.txt text eol=lf
*.lvdash.json text eol=lf
