      The dashboard resource allows you to manage [AI/BI dashboards](/api/workspace/lakeview/create) in a bundle. For information about AI/BI dashboards, see [_](/dashboards/index.md).
    "markdown_examples": |-
      The following example includes and deploys the sample __NYC Taxi Trip Analysis__ dashboard to the Databricks workspace.

      ``` yaml
      resources:

      ```
      If you use the UI to modify the dashboard, modifications made through the UI are not applied to the dashboard JSON file in the local bundle unless you explicitly update it using `bundle generate`. You can use the `--watch` option to continuously poll and retrieve changes to the dashboard. See [_](/dev-tools/cli/bundle-commands.md#generate).

      In addition, if you attempt to deploy a bundle that contains a dashboard JSON file that is different than the one in the remote workspace, an error will occur. To force the deploy and overwrite the dashboard in the remote workspace with the local one, use the `--force` option. See [_](/dev-tools/cli/bundle-commands.md#deploy).

      The schema resource type allows you to define Unity Catalog [schemas](/api/workspace/schemas/create) for tables and other assets in your workflows and pipelines created as part of a bundle. A schema, different from other resource types, has the following limitations:

      - The owner of a schema resource is always the deployment user, and cannot be changed. If `run_as` is specified in the bundle, it will be ignored by operations on the schema.
      - Only fields supported by the corresponding [Schemas object create API](/api/workspace/schemas/create) are available for the schema resource. For example, `enable_predictive_optimization` is not supported as it is only available on the [update API](/api/workspace/schemas/update).
    "markdown_examples": |-
      The following example defines a pipeline with the resource key `my_pipeline` that creates a Unity Catalog schema with the key `my_schema` as the target:

      ```yaml
      resources:
        pipelines:
          my_pipeline:
            name: test-pipeline-{{.unique_id}}
            libraries:

                  path: ./nb.sql
            development: true
            catalog: main
            target: ${resources.schemas.my_schema.id}

        schemas:
          my_schema:
            name: test-schema-{{.unique_id}}
            catalog_name: main
            comment: This schema was created by DABs.
      ```

      A top-level grants mapping is not supported by Databricks Asset Bundles, so if you want to set grants for a schema, define the grants for the schema within the `schemas` mapping. For more information about grants, see [_](/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/index.md#grant).

      The following example defines a Unity Catalog schema with grants:

      ```yaml

  "_":
    "markdown_description": |-
      The volume resource type allows you to define and create Unity Catalog [volumes](/api/workspace/volumes/create) as part of a bundle. When deploying a bundle with a volume defined, note that:

      - A volume cannot be referenced in the `artifact_path` for the bundle until it exists in the workspace. Hence, if you want to use Databricks Asset Bundles to create the volume, you must first define the volume in the bundle, deploy it to create the volume, then reference it in the `artifact_path` in subsequent deployments.

      - Volumes in the bundle are not prepended with the `dev_${workspace.current_user.short_name}` prefix when the deployment target has `mode: development` configured. However, you can manually configure this prefix. See [_](/dev-tools/bundles/deployment-modes.md#custom-presets).
    "markdown_examples": |-
      The following example creates a Unity Catalog volume with the key `my_volume`:

      ```yaml
      resources:
        volumes:
          my_volume:
            catalog_name: main
            name: my_volume
            schema_name: my_schema
      ```

      For an example bundle that runs a job that writes to a file in Unity Catalog volume, see the [bundle-examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/databricks/bundle-examples/tree/main/knowledge_base/write_from_job_to_volume).
