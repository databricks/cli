      This field encodes, through a single value, the resources available to each of
      the Spark nodes in this cluster. For example, the Spark nodes can be provisioned

      and `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.

      Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number
      of workers rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster
      is resized from 5 to 10 workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect
      the target size of 10 workers, whereas the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually
      increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are provisioned.

      Remove `-photon-` from the `spark_version` and set `runtime_engine` to `PHOTON`.

      If left unspecified, the runtime engine defaults to standard unless the spark_version
      contains -photon-, in which case Photon will be used.

      In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending
      them to `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all
      default databricks managed environmental variables are included as well.

      Example Spark environment variables:
      `{"SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY": "28000m", "SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS": "/local_disk0"}` or
      `{"SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS": "$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS -Dspark.shuffle.service.enabled=true"}`

      An optional specification for a remote Git repository containing the source code used by tasks. Version-controlled source code is supported by notebook, dbt, Python script, and SQL File tasks.

      If `git_source` is set, these tasks retrieve the file from the remote repository by default. However, this behavior can be overridden by setting `source` to `WORKSPACE` on the task.

      Note: dbt and SQL File tasks support only version-controlled sources. If dbt or SQL File tasks are used, `git_source` must be defined on the job.

    "deprecated": "false"
  "max_concurrent_runs":
    "description": |-
      An optional maximum allowed number of concurrent runs of the job.
      Set this value if you want to be able to execute multiple runs of the same job concurrently.
      This is useful for example if you trigger your job on a frequent schedule and want to allow consecutive runs to overlap with each other, or if you want to trigger multiple runs which differ by their input parameters.
      This setting affects only new runs. For example, suppose the job’s concurrency is 4 and there are 4 concurrent active runs. Then setting the concurrency to 3 won’t kill any of the active runs.
      However, from then on, new runs are skipped unless there are fewer than 3 active runs.
      This value cannot exceed 1000. Setting this value to `0` causes all new runs to be skipped.

      utilization. If no EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use instance

      * `SINGLE_USER`: A secure cluster that can only be exclusively used by a single user specified in `single_user_name`. Most programming languages, cluster features and data governance features are available in this mode.
      * `USER_ISOLATION`: A secure cluster that can be shared by multiple users. Cluster users are fully isolated so that they cannot see each other's data and credentials. Most data governance features are supported in this mode. But programming languages and cluster features might be limited.

      The following modes are deprecated starting with Databricks Runtime 15.0 and
      will be removed for future Databricks Runtime versions:

      * `LEGACY_TABLE_ACL`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Table ACL clusters.
      * `LEGACY_PASSTHROUGH`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on high concurrency clusters.
      * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on standard clusters.
      * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER_STANDARD`: This mode provides a way that doesn’t have UC nor passthrough enabled.

      and `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.

      Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number
      of workers rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster
      is resized from 5 to 10 workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect
      the target size of 10 workers, whereas the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually
      increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are provisioned.

      Please note that key-value pair of the form (X,Y) will be exported as is (i.e.,
      `export X='Y'`) while launching the driver and workers.

      In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending
      them to `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all
      default databricks managed environmental variables are included as well.

      Example Spark environment variables:
      `{"SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY": "28000m", "SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS": "/local_disk0"}` or
      `{"SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS": "$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS -Dspark.shuffle.service.enabled=true"}`
