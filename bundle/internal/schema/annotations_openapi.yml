      This field encodes, through a single value, the resources available to each of
      the Spark nodes in this cluster. For example, the Spark nodes can be provisioned
      and optimized for memory or compute intensive workloads. A list of available node
      types can be retrieved by using the :method:clusters/listNodeTypes API call.
  "num_workers":
    "description": |-
      Number of worker nodes that this cluster should have. A cluster has one Spark Driver
      and `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.

      Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number
      of workers rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster
      is resized from 5 to 10 workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect
      the target size of 10 workers, whereas the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually
      increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are provisioned.

      Please note that key-value pair of the form (X,Y) will be exported as is (i.e.,
      `export X='Y'`) while launching the driver and workers.

      In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending
      them to `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all
      default databricks managed environmental variables are included as well.

      Example Spark environment variables:
      `{"SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY": "28000m", "SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS": "/local_disk0"}` or
      `{"SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS": "$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS -Dspark.shuffle.service.enabled=true"}`

  "max_concurrent_runs":
    "description": |-
      An optional maximum allowed number of concurrent runs of the job.
      Set this value if you want to be able to execute multiple runs of the same job concurrently.
      This is useful for example if you trigger your job on a frequent schedule and want to allow consecutive runs to overlap with each other, or if you want to trigger multiple runs which differ by their input parameters.
      This setting affects only new runs. For example, suppose the job’s concurrency is 4 and there are 4 concurrent active runs. Then setting the concurrency to 3 won’t kill any of the active runs.
      However, from then on, new runs are skipped unless there are fewer than 3 active runs.
      This value cannot exceed 1000. Setting this value to `0` causes all new runs to be skipped.

      The number of volumes launched for each instance. Users can choose up to 10 volumes.
      This feature is only enabled for supported node types. Legacy node types cannot specify
      custom EBS volumes.
      For node types with no instance store, at least one EBS volume needs to be specified;
      otherwise, cluster creation will fail.

      These EBS volumes will be mounted at `/ebs0`, `/ebs1`, and etc.
      Instance store volumes will be mounted at `/local_disk0`, `/local_disk1`, and etc.

      If EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use only the EBS volumes for
      scratch storage because heterogenously sized scratch devices can lead to inefficient disk
      utilization. If no EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use instance
      store volumes.

      Please note that if EBS volumes are specified, then the Spark configuration `spark.local.dir`
      will be overridden.

  "spot_bid_price_percent":

      For example, if this field is set to 50, and the cluster needs a new `r3.xlarge` spot
      instance, then the bid price is half of the price of
      on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. Similarly, if this field is set to 200, the bid price is twice
      the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. If not specified, the default value is 100.
      When spot instances are requested for this cluster, only spot instances whose bid price
      percentage matches this field will be considered.
      Note that, for safety, we enforce this field to be no more than 10000.

      The default value and documentation here should be kept consistent with
      CommonConf.defaultSpotBidPricePercent and CommonConf.maxSpotBidPricePercent.
  "zone_id":

      is not a valid zone id if the Databricks deployment resides in the "us-east-1" region.
      This is an optional field at cluster creation, and if not specified, a default zone will be used.
      If the zone specified is "auto", will try to place cluster in a zone with high availability,
      and will retry placement in a different AZ if there is not enough capacity.

      This field encodes, through a single value, the resources available to each of
      the Spark nodes in this cluster. For example, the Spark nodes can be provisioned
      and optimized for memory or compute intensive workloads. A list of available node

  "num_workers":
    "description": |-
      Number of worker nodes that this cluster should have. A cluster has one Spark Driver
      and `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.

      Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number
      of workers rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster
      is resized from 5 to 10 workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect
      the target size of 10 workers, whereas the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually
      increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are provisioned.

      Please note that key-value pair of the form (X,Y) will be exported as is (i.e.,
      `export X='Y'`) while launching the driver and workers.

      In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending
      them to `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all
      default databricks managed environmental variables are included as well.

      Example Spark environment variables:

  "_":
    "description": |
      Data security mode decides what data governance model to use when accessing data
      from a cluster.

      The following modes can only be used with `kind`.
      * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_AUTO`: Databricks will choose the most appropriate access mode depending on your compute configuration.
      * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_STANDARD`: Alias for `USER_ISOLATION`.
      * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_DEDICATED`: Alias for `SINGLE_USER`.

      The following modes can be used regardless of `kind`.
      * `NONE`: No security isolation for multiple users sharing the cluster. Data governance features are not available in this mode.
      * `SINGLE_USER`: A secure cluster that can only be exclusively used by a single user specified in `single_user_name`. Most programming languages, cluster features and data governance features are available in this mode.
      * `USER_ISOLATION`: A secure cluster that can be shared by multiple users. Cluster users are fully isolated so that they cannot see each other's data and credentials. Most data governance features are supported in this mode. But programming languages and cluster features might be limited.

      The following modes are deprecated starting with Databricks Runtime 15.0 and
      will be removed for future Databricks Runtime versions:

      * `LEGACY_TABLE_ACL`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Table ACL clusters.
      * `LEGACY_PASSTHROUGH`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on high concurrency clusters.
      * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on standard clusters.
      * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER_STANDARD`: This mode provides a way that doesn’t have UC nor passthrough enabled.

      and `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.

      Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number
      of workers rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster
      is resized from 5 to 10 workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect
      the target size of 10 workers, whereas the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually
      increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are provisioned.

      In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending
      them to `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all
      default databricks managed environmental variables are included as well.

      Example Spark environment variables:
