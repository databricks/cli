      Additional tags for cluster resources. Databricks will tag all cluster resources (e.g., AWS
      instances and EBS volumes) with these tags in addition to `default_tags`. Notes:

      - Currently, Databricks allows at most 45 custom tags

      - Clusters can only reuse cloud resources if the resources' tags are a subset of the cluster tags
  "data_security_mode":
    "description": |-
      Data security mode decides what data governance model to use when accessing data
      from a cluster.

      The following modes can only be used when `kind = CLASSIC_PREVIEW`.
      * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_AUTO`: Databricks will choose the most appropriate access mode depending on your compute configuration.
      * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_STANDARD`: Alias for `USER_ISOLATION`.
      * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_DEDICATED`: Alias for `SINGLE_USER`.

      The following modes can be used regardless of `kind`.
      * `NONE`: No security isolation for multiple users sharing the cluster. Data governance features are not available in this mode.
      * `SINGLE_USER`: A secure cluster that can only be exclusively used by a single user specified in `single_user_name`. Most programming languages, cluster features and data governance features are available in this mode.
      * `USER_ISOLATION`: A secure cluster that can be shared by multiple users. Cluster users are fully isolated so that they cannot see each other's data and credentials. Most data governance features are supported in this mode. But programming languages and cluster features might be limited.

      The following modes are deprecated starting with Databricks Runtime 15.0 and
      will be removed for future Databricks Runtime versions:

      * `LEGACY_TABLE_ACL`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Table ACL clusters.
      * `LEGACY_PASSTHROUGH`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on high concurrency clusters.
      * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on standard clusters.
      * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER_STANDARD`: This mode provides a way that doesn’t have UC nor passthrough enabled.
  "docker_image":

      Custom docker image BYOC
  "driver_instance_pool_id":
    "description": |-
      The optional ID of the instance pool for the driver of the cluster belongs.
      The pool cluster uses the instance pool with id (instance_pool_id) if the driver pool is not
      assigned.
  "driver_node_type_id":
    "description": |-
      The node type of the Spark driver.
      Note that this field is optional; if unset, the driver node type will be set as the same value
      as `node_type_id` defined above.

      This field, along with node_type_id, should not be set if virtual_cluster_size is set.
      If both driver_node_type_id, node_type_id, and virtual_cluster_size are specified, driver_node_type_id and node_type_id take precedence.
  "enable_elastic_disk":
    "description": |-
      Autoscaling Local Storage: when enabled, this cluster will dynamically acquire additional disk
      space when its Spark workers are running low on disk space. This feature requires specific AWS
      permissions to function correctly - refer to the User Guide for more details.

  "instance_pool_id":
    "description": |-
      The optional ID of the instance pool to which the cluster belongs.
  "is_single_node":
    "description": |-
      This field can only be used when `kind = CLASSIC_PREVIEW`.

      When set to true, Databricks will automatically set single node related `custom_tags`, `spark_conf`, and `num_workers`
  "kind":
    "description": |-
      The kind of compute described by this compute specification.

      Depending on `kind`, different validations and default values will be applied.

      Clusters with `kind = CLASSIC_PREVIEW` support the following fields, whereas clusters with no specified `kind` do not.
      * [is_single_node](/api/workspace/clusters/create#is_single_node)
      * [use_ml_runtime](/api/workspace/clusters/create#use_ml_runtime)
      * [data_security_mode](/api/workspace/clusters/create#data_security_mode) set to `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_AUTO`, `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_DEDICATED`, or `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_STANDARD`

      By using the [simple form](https://docs.databricks.com/compute/simple-form.html), your clusters are automatically using `kind = CLASSIC_PREVIEW`.
  "node_type_id":
    "description": |-
      This field encodes, through a single value, the resources available to each of
      the Spark nodes in this cluster. For example, the Spark nodes can be provisioned
      and optimized for memory or compute intensive workloads. A list of available node
      types can be retrieved by using the :method:clusters/listNodeTypes API call.
  "num_workers":
    "description": |-
      Number of worker nodes that this cluster should have. A cluster has one Spark Driver
      and `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.

      Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number
      of workers rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster
      is resized from 5 to 10 workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect
      the target size of 10 workers, whereas the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually
      increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are provisioned.
  "policy_id":
    "description": |-
      The ID of the cluster policy used to create the cluster if applicable.
  "remote_disk_throughput":

  "runtime_engine":
    "description": |-
      Determines the cluster's runtime engine, either standard or Photon.

      This field is not compatible with legacy `spark_version` values that contain `-photon-`.
      Remove `-photon-` from the `spark_version` and set `runtime_engine` to `PHOTON`.

      If left unspecified, the runtime engine defaults to standard unless the spark_version
      contains -photon-, in which case Photon will be used.
  "single_user_name":
    "description": |-
      Single user name if data_security_mode is `SINGLE_USER`
  "spark_conf":
    "description": |-
      An object containing a set of optional, user-specified Spark configuration key-value pairs.
      Users can also pass in a string of extra JVM options to the driver and the executors via
      `spark.driver.extraJavaOptions` and `spark.executor.extraJavaOptions` respectively.
  "spark_env_vars":
    "description": |-
      An object containing a set of optional, user-specified environment variable key-value pairs.
      Please note that key-value pair of the form (X,Y) will be exported as is (i.e.,
      `export X='Y'`) while launching the driver and workers.

      In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending
      them to `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all
      default databricks managed environmental variables are included as well.

      Example Spark environment variables:
      `{"SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY": "28000m", "SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS": "/local_disk0"}` or
      `{"SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS": "$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS -Dspark.shuffle.service.enabled=true"}`
  "spark_version":
    "description": |-
      The Spark version of the cluster, e.g. `3.3.x-scala2.11`.

  "format":
    "description": |-
      Used to tell what is the format of the job. This field is ignored in Create/Update/Reset calls. When using the Jobs API 2.1 this value is always set to `"MULTI_TASK"`.
    "deprecation_message": |-
      This field is deprecated
  "git_source":
    "description": |-
      An optional specification for a remote Git repository containing the source code used by tasks. Version-controlled source code is supported by notebook, dbt, Python script, and SQL File tasks.

      If `git_source` is set, these tasks retrieve the file from the remote repository by default. However, this behavior can be overridden by setting `source` to `WORKSPACE` on the task.

      Note: dbt and SQL File tasks support only version-controlled sources. If dbt or SQL File tasks are used, `git_source` must be defined on the job.
  "health":
    "description": |-
      An optional set of health rules that can be defined for this job.
  "job_clusters":
    "description": |-
      A list of job cluster specifications that can be shared and reused by tasks of this job. Libraries cannot be declared in a shared job cluster. You must declare dependent libraries in task settings.
  "max_concurrent_runs":
    "description": |-
      An optional maximum allowed number of concurrent runs of the job.
      Set this value if you want to be able to execute multiple runs of the same job concurrently.
      This is useful for example if you trigger your job on a frequent schedule and want to allow consecutive runs to overlap with each other, or if you want to trigger multiple runs which differ by their input parameters.
      This setting affects only new runs. For example, suppose the job’s concurrency is 4 and there are 4 concurrent active runs. Then setting the concurrency to 3 won’t kill any of the active runs.
      However, from then on, new runs are skipped unless there are fewer than 3 active runs.
      This value cannot exceed 1000. Setting this value to `0` causes all new runs to be skipped.
  "name":
    "description": |-
      An optional name for the job. The maximum length is 4096 bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

  "tags":
    "description": |-
      A map of tags associated with the job. These are forwarded to the cluster as cluster tags for jobs clusters, and are subject to the same limitations as cluster tags. A maximum of 25 tags can be added to the job.
  "tasks":
    "description": |-
      A list of task specifications to be executed by this job.
      It supports up to 1000 elements in write endpoints (:method:jobs/create, :method:jobs/reset, :method:jobs/update, :method:jobs/submit).
      Read endpoints return only 100 tasks. If more than 100 tasks are available, you can paginate through them using :method:jobs/get. Use the `next_page_token` field at the object root to determine if more results are available.

      Instance store volumes will be mounted at `/local_disk0`, `/local_disk1`, and etc.

      If EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use only the EBS volumes for
      scratch storage because heterogenously sized scratch devices can lead to inefficient disk
      utilization. If no EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use instance
      store volumes.

      The size of each EBS volume (in GiB) launched for each instance. For general purpose
      SSD, this value must be within the range 100 - 4096. For throughput optimized HDD,
      this value must be within the range 500 - 4096.

      The first `first_on_demand` nodes of the cluster will be placed on on-demand instances.
      If this value is greater than 0, the cluster driver node in particular will be placed on an
      on-demand instance. If this value is greater than or equal to the current cluster size, all
      nodes will be placed on on-demand instances. If this value is less than the current cluster
      size, `first_on_demand` nodes will be placed on on-demand instances and the remainder will
      be placed on `availability` instances. Note that this value does not affect
      cluster size and cannot currently be mutated over the lifetime of a cluster.
  "instance_profile_arn":
    "description": |-
      Nodes for this cluster will only be placed on AWS instances with this instance profile. If
      ommitted, nodes will be placed on instances without an IAM instance profile. The instance
      profile must have previously been added to the Databricks environment by an account
      administrator.

      This feature may only be available to certain customer plans.
  "spot_bid_price_percent":
    "description": |-
      The bid price for AWS spot instances, as a percentage of the corresponding instance type's
      on-demand price.
      For example, if this field is set to 50, and the cluster needs a new `r3.xlarge` spot
      instance, then the bid price is half of the price of
      on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. Similarly, if this field is set to 200, the bid price is twice
      the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. If not specified, the default value is 100.
      When spot instances are requested for this cluster, only spot instances whose bid price
      percentage matches this field will be considered.
      Note that, for safety, we enforce this field to be no more than 10000.
  "zone_id":
    "description": |-
      Identifier for the availability zone/datacenter in which the cluster resides.
      This string will be of a form like "us-west-2a". The provided availability
      zone must be in the same region as the Databricks deployment. For example, "us-west-2a"
      is not a valid zone id if the Databricks deployment resides in the "us-east-1" region.
      This is an optional field at cluster creation, and if not specified, a default zone will be used.
      If the zone specified is "auto", will try to place cluster in a zone with high availability,
      and will retry placement in a different AZ if there is not enough capacity.

      The list of available zones as well as the default value can be found by using the
      `List Zones` method.

      * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_STANDARD`: Alias for `USER_ISOLATION`.
      * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_DEDICATED`: Alias for `SINGLE_USER`.

      The following modes can be used regardless of `kind`.
      * `NONE`: No security isolation for multiple users sharing the cluster. Data governance features are not available in this mode.
      * `SINGLE_USER`: A secure cluster that can only be exclusively used by a single user specified in `single_user_name`. Most programming languages, cluster features and data governance features are available in this mode.
      * `USER_ISOLATION`: A secure cluster that can be shared by multiple users. Cluster users are fully isolated so that they cannot see each other's data and credentials. Most data governance features are supported in this mode. But programming languages and cluster features might be limited.

      The following modes are deprecated starting with Databricks Runtime 15.0 and
      will be removed for future Databricks Runtime versions:

      * `LEGACY_TABLE_ACL`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Table ACL clusters.

      and `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.

      Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number
      of workers rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster
      is resized from 5 to 10 workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect
      the target size of 10 workers, whereas the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually
      increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are provisioned.

      Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number
      of workers rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster
      is resized from 5 to 10 workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect
      the target size of 10 workers, whereas the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually
      increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are provisioned.

      In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending
      them to `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all
      default databricks managed environmental variables are included as well.

      Example Spark environment variables:
      `{"SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY": "28000m", "SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS": "/local_disk0"}` or
