### Overview

`docs/bundle_descriptions.json` contains both autogenerated as well as manually written
descriptions for the json schema. Specifically
1. `resources` : almost all descriptions are autogenerated from the OpenAPI spec
2. `targets` : almost all descriptions are copied over from root level entities (eg: `bundle`, `artifacts`)
3. `bundle` : manually editted
4. `include` : manually editted
5. `workspace` : manually editted
6. `artifacts` : manually editted

These descriptions are rendered in the inline documentation in an IDE

### SOP: Add schema descriptions for new fields in bundle config

Manually edit bundle_descriptions.json to add your descriptions. Note that the
descriptions in `resources`` block is generated from the OpenAPI spec, and thus
any changes there will be overwritten.
