# :re[DABS] resources

:re[DABS] allows you to specify information about the :re[Databricks] resources used by the bundle in the `resources` mapping in the bundle configuration. See [resources mapping](settings.md#resources) and [resources key reference](reference.md#resources).

This article outlines supported resource types for bundles and provides details and an example for each supported type. For additional examples, see [\_](resource-examples.md).

## <a id="resource-types"></a>Supported resources

The following table lists supported resource types for bundles. Some resources can be created by defining them in a bundle and deploying the bundle, and some resources only support referencing an existing resource to include in the bundle.

Resources are defined using the corresponding [Databricks REST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction) object’s create operation request payload, where the object’s supported fields, expressed as YAML, are the resource’s supported properties. Links to documentation for each resource’s corresponding payloads are listed in the table.

:::tip

The `databricks bundle validate` command returns warnings if unknown resource properties are found in bundle configuration files.
