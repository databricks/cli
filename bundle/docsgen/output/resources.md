# <DABS> resources

<DABS> allows you to specify information about the <Databricks> resources used by the bundle in the `resources` mapping in the bundle configuration. See [resources mapping](/dev-tools/bundles/settings.md#resources) and [resources key reference](/dev-tools/bundles/reference.md#resources).

This article outlines supported resource types for bundles and provides details and an example for each supported type. For additional examples, see [_](/dev-tools/bundles/resource-examples.md).

## <a id="resource-types"></a> Supported resources

The following table lists supported resource types for bundles. Some resources can be created by defining them in a bundle and deploying the bundle, and some resources only support referencing an existing resource to include in the bundle.

Resources are defined using the corresponding [Databricks REST API](/api/workspace/introduction) object's create operation request payload, where the object's supported fields, expressed as YAML, are the resource's supported properties. Links to documentation for each resource's corresponding payloads are listed in the table.

.. tip:: The `databricks bundle validate` command returns warnings if unknown resource properties are found in bundle configuration files.

## clusters
  
**`Type: Map`**
  
The cluster resource defines an [all-purpose cluster](/api/workspace/clusters/create).
  
```yaml
clusters:
  <cluster-name>:
    <cluster-field-name>: <cluster-field-value>
```
  
  
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
  
   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - `apply_policy_default_values`
     - Boolean
     - When set to true, fixed and default values from the policy will be used for fields that are omitted. When set to false, only fixed values from the policy will be applied.
  
   * - `autoscale`
     - Map
     - Parameters needed in order to automatically scale clusters up and down based on load. Note: autoscaling works best with DB runtime versions 3.0 or later. See [_](#clustersnameautoscale).
  
   * - `autotermination_minutes`
     - Integer
     - Automatically terminates the cluster after it is inactive for this time in minutes. If not set, this cluster will not be automatically terminated. If specified, the threshold must be between 10 and 10000 minutes. Users can also set this value to 0 to explicitly disable automatic termination.
  
   * - `aws_attributes`
     - Map
     - Attributes related to clusters running on Amazon Web Services. If not specified at cluster creation, a set of default values will be used. See [_](#clustersnameaws_attributes).
  
   * - `azure_attributes`
     - Map
     - Attributes related to clusters running on Microsoft Azure. If not specified at cluster creation, a set of default values will be used. See [_](#clustersnameazure_attributes).
  
   * - `cluster_log_conf`
     - Map
     - The configuration for delivering spark logs to a long-term storage destination. Two kinds of destinations (dbfs and s3) are supported. Only one destination can be specified for one cluster. If the conf is given, the logs will be delivered to the destination every `5 mins`. The destination of driver logs is `$destination/$clusterId/driver`, while the destination of executor logs is `$destination/$clusterId/executor`. See [_](#clustersnamecluster_log_conf).
  
   * - `cluster_name`
     - String
     - Cluster name requested by the user. This doesn't have to be unique. If not specified at creation, the cluster name will be an empty string. 
  
   * - `custom_tags`
     - Map
     - Additional tags for cluster resources. Databricks will tag all cluster resources (e.g., AWS instances and EBS volumes) with these tags in addition to `default_tags`. Notes:  - Currently, Databricks allows at most 45 custom tags  - Clusters can only reuse cloud resources if the resources' tags are a subset of the cluster tags
  
   * - `data_security_mode`
     - String
     - Data security mode decides what data governance model to use when accessing data from a cluster.  The following modes can only be used with `kind`. * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_AUTO`: Databricks will choose the most appropriate access mode depending on your compute configuration. * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_STANDARD`: Alias for `USER_ISOLATION`. * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_DEDICATED`: Alias for `SINGLE_USER`.  The following modes can be used regardless of `kind`. * `NONE`: No security isolation for multiple users sharing the cluster. Data governance features are not available in this mode. * `SINGLE_USER`: A secure cluster that can only be exclusively used by a single user specified in `single_user_name`. Most programming languages, cluster features and data governance features are available in this mode. * `USER_ISOLATION`: A secure cluster that can be shared by multiple users. Cluster users are fully isolated so that they cannot see each other's data and credentials. Most data governance features are supported in this mode. But programming languages and cluster features might be limited.  The following modes are deprecated starting with Databricks Runtime 15.0 and will be removed for future Databricks Runtime versions:  * `LEGACY_TABLE_ACL`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Table ACL clusters. * `LEGACY_PASSTHROUGH`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on high concurrency clusters. * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on standard clusters. * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER_STANDARD`: This mode provides a way that doesn’t have UC nor passthrough enabled. 
  
   * - `docker_image`
     - Map
     - See [_](#clustersnamedocker_image).
  
   * - `driver_instance_pool_id`
     - String
     - The optional ID of the instance pool for the driver of the cluster belongs. The pool cluster uses the instance pool with id (instance_pool_id) if the driver pool is not assigned.
  
   * - `driver_node_type_id`
     - String
     - The node type of the Spark driver. Note that this field is optional; if unset, the driver node type will be set as the same value as `node_type_id` defined above. 
  
   * - `enable_elastic_disk`
     - Boolean
     - Autoscaling Local Storage: when enabled, this cluster will dynamically acquire additional disk space when its Spark workers are running low on disk space. This feature requires specific AWS permissions to function correctly - refer to the User Guide for more details.
  
   * - `enable_local_disk_encryption`
     - Boolean
     - Whether to enable LUKS on cluster VMs' local disks
  
   * - `gcp_attributes`
     - Map
     - Attributes related to clusters running on Google Cloud Platform. If not specified at cluster creation, a set of default values will be used. See [_](#clustersnamegcp_attributes).
  
   * - `init_scripts`
     - Sequence
     - The configuration for storing init scripts. Any number of destinations can be specified. The scripts are executed sequentially in the order provided. If `cluster_log_conf` is specified, init script logs are sent to `<destination>/<cluster-ID>/init_scripts`. See [_](#clustersnameinit_scripts).
  
   * - `instance_pool_id`
     - String
     - The optional ID of the instance pool to which the cluster belongs.
  
   * - `is_single_node`
     - Boolean
     - This field can only be used with `kind`.  When set to true, Databricks will automatically set single node related `custom_tags`, `spark_conf`, and `num_workers` 
  
   * - `kind`
     - String
     - 
  
   * - `node_type_id`
     - String
     - This field encodes, through a single value, the resources available to each of the Spark nodes in this cluster. For example, the Spark nodes can be provisioned and optimized for memory or compute intensive workloads. A list of available node types can be retrieved by using the :method:clusters/listNodeTypes API call. 
  
   * - `num_workers`
     - Integer
     - Number of worker nodes that this cluster should have. A cluster has one Spark Driver and `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.  Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number of workers rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster is resized from 5 to 10 workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect the target size of 10 workers, whereas the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are provisioned.
  
   * - `permissions`
     - Sequence
     - See [_](#clustersnamepermissions).
  
   * - `policy_id`
     - String
     - The ID of the cluster policy used to create the cluster if applicable.
  
   * - `runtime_engine`
     - String
     - Determines the cluster's runtime engine, either standard or Photon.  This field is not compatible with legacy `spark_version` values that contain `-photon-`. Remove `-photon-` from the `spark_version` and set `runtime_engine` to `PHOTON`.  If left unspecified, the runtime engine defaults to standard unless the spark_version contains -photon-, in which case Photon will be used. 
  
   * - `single_user_name`
     - String
     - Single user name if data_security_mode is `SINGLE_USER`
  
   * - `spark_conf`
     - Map
     - An object containing a set of optional, user-specified Spark configuration key-value pairs. Users can also pass in a string of extra JVM options to the driver and the executors via `spark.driver.extraJavaOptions` and `spark.executor.extraJavaOptions` respectively. 
  
   * - `spark_env_vars`
     - Map
     - An object containing a set of optional, user-specified environment variable key-value pairs. Please note that key-value pair of the form (X,Y) will be exported as is (i.e., `export X='Y'`) while launching the driver and workers.  In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending them to `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all default databricks managed environmental variables are included as well.  Example Spark environment variables: `{"SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY": "28000m", "SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS": "/local_disk0"}` or `{"SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS": "$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS -Dspark.shuffle.service.enabled=true"}`
  
   * - `spark_version`
     - String
     - The Spark version of the cluster, e.g. `3.3.x-scala2.11`. A list of available Spark versions can be retrieved by using the :method:clusters/sparkVersions API call. 
  
   * - `ssh_public_keys`
     - Sequence
     - SSH public key contents that will be added to each Spark node in this cluster. The corresponding private keys can be used to login with the user name `ubuntu` on port `2200`. Up to 10 keys can be specified.
  
   * - `use_ml_runtime`
     - Boolean
     - This field can only be used with `kind`.  `effective_spark_version` is determined by `spark_version` (DBR release), this field `use_ml_runtime`, and whether `node_type_id` is gpu node or not. 
  
   * - `workload_type`
     - Map
     - See [_](#clustersnameworkload_type).
  
  
**Example**
  
The following example creates a cluster named `my_cluster` and sets that as the cluster to use to run the notebook in `my_job`:

```yaml
bundle:
  name: clusters

resources:
  clusters:
    my_cluster:
      num_workers: 2
      node_type_id: "i3.xlarge"
      autoscale:
        min_workers: 2
        max_workers: 7
      spark_version: "13.3.x-scala2.12"
      spark_conf:
        "spark.executor.memory": "2g"

  jobs:
    my_job:
      tasks:
        - task_key: test_task
          notebook_task:
            notebook_path: "./src/my_notebook.py"
```
  
### clusters.\<name\>.autoscale
  
**`Type: Map`**
  
Parameters needed in order to automatically scale clusters up and down based on load.
Note: autoscaling works best with DB runtime versions 3.0 or later.
  
  
  
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
  
   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - `max_workers`
     - Integer
     - The maximum number of workers to which the cluster can scale up when overloaded. Note that `max_workers` must be strictly greater than `min_workers`.
  
   * - `min_workers`
     - Integer
     - The minimum number of workers to which the cluster can scale down when underutilized. It is also the initial number of workers the cluster will have after creation.
  
  
### clusters.\<name\>.aws_attributes
  
**`Type: Map`**
  
Attributes related to clusters running on Amazon Web Services.
If not specified at cluster creation, a set of default values will be used.
  
  
  
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
  
   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - `availability`
     - String
     - Availability type used for all subsequent nodes past the `first_on_demand` ones.  Note: If `first_on_demand` is zero, this availability type will be used for the entire cluster. 
  
   * - `ebs_volume_count`
     - Integer
     - The number of volumes launched for each instance. Users can choose up to 10 volumes. This feature is only enabled for supported node types. Legacy node types cannot specify custom EBS volumes. For node types with no instance store, at least one EBS volume needs to be specified; otherwise, cluster creation will fail.  These EBS volumes will be mounted at `/ebs0`, `/ebs1`, and etc. Instance store volumes will be mounted at `/local_disk0`, `/local_disk1`, and etc.  If EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use only the EBS volumes for scratch storage because heterogenously sized scratch devices can lead to inefficient disk utilization. If no EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use instance store volumes.  Please note that if EBS volumes are specified, then the Spark configuration `spark.local.dir` will be overridden.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_iops`
     - Integer
     - If using gp3 volumes, what IOPS to use for the disk. If this is not set, the maximum performance of a gp2 volume with the same volume size will be used.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_size`
     - Integer
     - The size of each EBS volume (in GiB) launched for each instance. For general purpose SSD, this value must be within the range 100 - 4096. For throughput optimized HDD, this value must be within the range 500 - 4096.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_throughput`
     - Integer
     - If using gp3 volumes, what throughput to use for the disk. If this is not set, the maximum performance of a gp2 volume with the same volume size will be used.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_type`
     - String
     - The type of EBS volumes that will be launched with this cluster.
  
   * - `first_on_demand`
     - Integer
     - The first `first_on_demand` nodes of the cluster will be placed on on-demand instances. If this value is greater than 0, the cluster driver node in particular will be placed on an on-demand instance. If this value is greater than or equal to the current cluster size, all nodes will be placed on on-demand instances. If this value is less than the current cluster size, `first_on_demand` nodes will be placed on on-demand instances and the remainder will be placed on `availability` instances. Note that this value does not affect cluster size and cannot currently be mutated over the lifetime of a cluster.
  
   * - `instance_profile_arn`
     - String
     - Nodes for this cluster will only be placed on AWS instances with this instance profile. If ommitted, nodes will be placed on instances without an IAM instance profile. The instance profile must have previously been added to the Databricks environment by an account administrator.  This feature may only be available to certain customer plans.  If this field is ommitted, we will pull in the default from the conf if it exists.
  
   * - `spot_bid_price_percent`
     - Integer
     - The bid price for AWS spot instances, as a percentage of the corresponding instance type's on-demand price. For example, if this field is set to 50, and the cluster needs a new `r3.xlarge` spot instance, then the bid price is half of the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. Similarly, if this field is set to 200, the bid price is twice the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. If not specified, the default value is 100. When spot instances are requested for this cluster, only spot instances whose bid price percentage matches this field will be considered. Note that, for safety, we enforce this field to be no more than 10000.  The default value and documentation here should be kept consistent with CommonConf.defaultSpotBidPricePercent and CommonConf.maxSpotBidPricePercent.
  
   * - `zone_id`
     - String
     - Identifier for the availability zone/datacenter in which the cluster resides. This string will be of a form like "us-west-2a". The provided availability zone must be in the same region as the Databricks deployment. For example, "us-west-2a" is not a valid zone id if the Databricks deployment resides in the "us-east-1" region. This is an optional field at cluster creation, and if not specified, a default zone will be used. If the zone specified is "auto", will try to place cluster in a zone with high availability, and will retry placement in a different AZ if there is not enough capacity. The list of available zones as well as the default value can be found by using the `List Zones` method.

      display_name: "NYC Taxi Trip Analysis"
      file_path: ../src/nyc_taxi_trip_analysis.lvdash.json
      warehouse_id: ${var.warehouse_id}
```
If you use the UI to modify the dashboard, modifications made through the UI are not applied to the dashboard JSON file in the local bundle unless you explicitly update it using `bundle generate`. You can use the `--watch` option to continuously poll and retrieve changes to the dashboard. See [_](/dev-tools/cli/bundle-commands.md#generate).

In addition, if you attempt to deploy a bundle that contains a dashboard JSON file that is different than the one in the remote workspace, an error will occur. To force the deploy and overwrite the dashboard in the remote workspace with the local one, use the `--force` option. See [_](/dev-tools/cli/bundle-commands.md#deploy).

The job resource allows you to define [jobs and their corresponding tasks](/api/workspace/jobs/create) in your bundle. For information about jobs, see [_](/jobs/index.md). For a tutorial that uses a <DABS> template to create a job, see [_](/dev-tools/bundles/jobs-tutorial.md).
  
```yaml
jobs:
  <job-name>:
    <job-field-name>: <job-field-value>
```
  
  
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
  
   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - `budget_policy_id`
     - String
     - The id of the user specified budget policy to use for this job. If not specified, a default budget policy may be applied when creating or modifying the job. See `effective_budget_policy_id` for the budget policy used by this workload.
  
   * - `continuous`
     - Map
     - An optional continuous property for this job. The continuous property will ensure that there is always one run executing. Only one of `schedule` and `continuous` can be used. See [_](#jobsnamecontinuous).
  
   * - `deployment`
     - Map
     - Deployment information for jobs managed by external sources. See [_](#jobsnamedeployment).
  
   * - `description`
     - String
     - An optional description for the job. The maximum length is 27700 characters in UTF-8 encoding.
  
   * - `edit_mode`
     - String
     - Edit mode of the job.  * `UI_LOCKED`: The job is in a locked UI state and cannot be modified. * `EDITABLE`: The job is in an editable state and can be modified.
  
   * - `email_notifications`
     - Map
     - An optional set of email addresses that is notified when runs of this job begin or complete as well as when this job is deleted. See [_](#jobsnameemail_notifications).
  
   * - `environments`
     - Sequence
     - A list of task execution environment specifications that can be referenced by serverless tasks of this job. An environment is required to be present for serverless tasks. For serverless notebook tasks, the environment is accessible in the notebook environment panel. For other serverless tasks, the task environment is required to be specified using environment_key in the task settings. See [_](#jobsnameenvironments).
  
   * - `format`
     - String
     - Used to tell what is the format of the job. This field is ignored in Create/Update/Reset calls. When using the Jobs API 2.1 this value is always set to `"MULTI_TASK"`.
  
   * - `git_source`
     - Map
     - An optional specification for a remote Git repository containing the source code used by tasks. Version-controlled source code is supported by notebook, dbt, Python script, and SQL File tasks.  If `git_source` is set, these tasks retrieve the file from the remote repository by default. However, this behavior can be overridden by setting `source` to `WORKSPACE` on the task.  Note: dbt and SQL File tasks support only version-controlled sources. If dbt or SQL File tasks are used, `git_source` must be defined on the job. See [_](#jobsnamegit_source).
  
   * - `health`
     - Map
     - An optional set of health rules that can be defined for this job. See [_](#jobsnamehealth).
  
   * - `job_clusters`
     - Sequence
     - A list of job cluster specifications that can be shared and reused by tasks of this job. Libraries cannot be declared in a shared job cluster. You must declare dependent libraries in task settings. If more than 100 job clusters are available, you can paginate through them using :method:jobs/get. See [_](#jobsnamejob_clusters).
  
   * - `max_concurrent_runs`
     - Integer
     - An optional maximum allowed number of concurrent runs of the job. Set this value if you want to be able to execute multiple runs of the same job concurrently. This is useful for example if you trigger your job on a frequent schedule and want to allow consecutive runs to overlap with each other, or if you want to trigger multiple runs which differ by their input parameters. This setting affects only new runs. For example, suppose the job’s concurrency is 4 and there are 4 concurrent active runs. Then setting the concurrency to 3 won’t kill any of the active runs. However, from then on, new runs are skipped unless there are fewer than 3 active runs. This value cannot exceed 1000. Setting this value to `0` causes all new runs to be skipped.
  
   * - `name`

   * - `run_as`
     - Map
     - Write-only setting. Specifies the user or service principal that the job runs as. If not specified, the job runs as the user who created the job.  Either `user_name` or `service_principal_name` should be specified. If not, an error is thrown. See [_](#jobsnamerun_as).
  
   * - `schedule`
     - Map
     - An optional periodic schedule for this job. The default behavior is that the job only runs when triggered by clicking “Run Now” in the Jobs UI or sending an API request to `runNow`. See [_](#jobsnameschedule).
  
   * - `tags`
     - Map
     - A map of tags associated with the job. These are forwarded to the cluster as cluster tags for jobs clusters, and are subject to the same limitations as cluster tags. A maximum of 25 tags can be added to the job.
  
   * - `tasks`
     - Sequence
     - A list of task specifications to be executed by this job. If more than 100 tasks are available, you can paginate through them using :method:jobs/get. Use the `next_page_token` field at the object root to determine if more results are available. See [_](#jobsnametasks).
  
   * - `timeout_seconds`
     - Integer
     - An optional timeout applied to each run of this job. A value of `0` means no timeout.
  
   * - `trigger`
     - Map

   * - `webhook_notifications`
     - Map
     - A collection of system notification IDs to notify when runs of this job begin or complete. See [_](#jobsnamewebhook_notifications).
  
  
**Example**
  
The following example defines a job with the resource key `hello-job` with one notebook task:

```yaml
resources:
  jobs:
    hello-job:
      name: hello-job
      tasks:
        - task_key: hello-task
          notebook_task:
            notebook_path: ./hello.py
```

The following modes can be used regardless of `kind`. * `NONE`: No security isolation for multiple users sharing the cluster. Data governance features are not available in this mode. * `SINGLE_USER`: A secure cluster that can only be exclusively used by a single user specified in `single_user_name`. Most programming languages, cluster features and data governance features are available in this mode. * `USER_ISOLATION`: A secure cluster that can be shared by multiple users. Cluster users are fully isolated so that they cannot see each other's data and credentials. Most data governance features are supported in this mode. But programming languages and cluster features might be limited.  The following modes are deprecated starting with Databricks Runtime 15.0 and will be removed for future Databricks Runtime versions:  * `LEGACY_TABLE_ACL`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Table ACL clusters. * `LEGACY_PASSTHROUGH`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on high concurrency clusters. * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on standard clusters. * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER_STANDARD`: This mode provides a way that doesn’t have UC nor passthrough enabled.

   * - `driver_instance_pool_id`
     - String
     - The optional ID of the instance pool for the driver of the cluster belongs. The pool cluster uses the instance pool with id (instance_pool_id) if the driver pool is not assigned.
  
   * - `driver_node_type_id`
     - String
     - The node type of the Spark driver. Note that this field is optional; if unset, the driver node type will be set as the same value as `node_type_id` defined above. 
  
   * - `enable_elastic_disk`
     - Boolean
     - Autoscaling Local Storage: when enabled, this cluster will dynamically acquire additional disk space when its Spark workers are running low on disk space. This feature requires specific AWS permissions to function correctly - refer to the User Guide for more details.
  
   * - `enable_local_disk_encryption`
     - Boolean
     - Whether to enable LUKS on cluster VMs' local disks
  
   * - `gcp_attributes`
     - Map
     - Attributes related to clusters running on Google Cloud Platform. If not specified at cluster creation, a set of default values will be used. See [_](#jobsnamejob_clustersnew_clustergcp_attributes).
  
   * - `init_scripts`
     - Sequence
     - The configuration for storing init scripts. Any number of destinations can be specified. The scripts are executed sequentially in the order provided. If `cluster_log_conf` is specified, init script logs are sent to `<destination>/<cluster-ID>/init_scripts`. See [_](#jobsnamejob_clustersnew_clusterinit_scripts).

     - The optional ID of the instance pool to which the cluster belongs.
  
   * - `is_single_node`
     - Boolean
     - This field can only be used with `kind`.  When set to true, Databricks will automatically set single node related `custom_tags`, `spark_conf`, and `num_workers` 
  
   * - `kind`
     - String
     - 
  
   * - `node_type_id`
     - String
     - This field encodes, through a single value, the resources available to each of the Spark nodes in this cluster.

A list of available node types can be retrieved by using the :method:clusters/listNodeTypes API call. 
  
   * - `num_workers`
     - Integer
     - Number of worker nodes that this cluster should have. A cluster has one Spark Driver and `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.  Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number of workers rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster is resized from 5 to 10 workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect the target size of 10 workers, whereas the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are provisioned.
  
   * - `policy_id`
     - String
     - The ID of the cluster policy used to create the cluster if applicable.
  
   * - `runtime_engine`
     - String
     - Determines the cluster's runtime engine, either standard or Photon.  This field is not compatible with legacy `spark_version` values that contain `-photon-`. Remove `-photon-` from the `spark_version` and set `runtime_engine` to `PHOTON`.  If left unspecified, the runtime engine defaults to standard unless the spark_version contains -photon-, in which case Photon will be used.

   * - `spark_env_vars`
     - Map
     - An object containing a set of optional, user-specified environment variable key-value pairs. Please note that key-value pair of the form (X,Y) will be exported as is (i.e., `export X='Y'`) while launching the driver and workers.  In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending them to `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all default databricks managed environmental variables are included as well.  Example Spark environment variables: `{"SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY": "28000m", "SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS": "/local_disk0"}` or `{"SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS": "$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS -Dspark.shuffle.service.enabled=true"}`

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
  
   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - `availability`
     - String
     - Availability type used for all subsequent nodes past the `first_on_demand` ones.  Note: If `first_on_demand` is zero, this availability type will be used for the entire cluster. 
  
   * - `ebs_volume_count`
     - Integer
     - The number of volumes launched for each instance. Users can choose up to 10 volumes. This feature is only enabled for supported node types. Legacy node types cannot specify custom EBS volumes. For node types with no instance store, at least one EBS volume needs to be specified; otherwise, cluster creation will fail.  These EBS volumes will be mounted at `/ebs0`, `/ebs1`, and etc. Instance store volumes will be mounted at `/local_disk0`, `/local_disk1`, and etc.  If EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use only the EBS volumes for scratch storage because heterogenously sized scratch devices can lead to inefficient disk utilization. If no EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use instance store volumes.  Please note that if EBS volumes are specified, then the Spark configuration `spark.local.dir` will be overridden.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_iops`
     - Integer
     - If using gp3 volumes, what IOPS to use for the disk. If this is not set, the maximum performance of a gp2 volume with the same volume size will be used.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_size`
     - Integer
     - The size of each EBS volume (in GiB) launched for each instance. For general purpose SSD, this value must be within the range 100 - 4096. For throughput optimized HDD, this value must be within the range 500 - 4096.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_throughput`
     - Integer
     - If using gp3 volumes, what throughput to use for the disk. If this is not set, the maximum performance of a gp2 volume with the same volume size will be used.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_type`
     - String
     - The type of EBS volumes that will be launched with this cluster.
  
   * - `first_on_demand`
     - Integer
     - The first `first_on_demand` nodes of the cluster will be placed on on-demand instances. If this value is greater than 0, the cluster driver node in particular will be placed on an on-demand instance. If this value is greater than or equal to the current cluster size, all nodes will be placed on on-demand instances. If this value is less than the current cluster size, `first_on_demand` nodes will be placed on on-demand instances and the remainder will be placed on `availability` instances. Note that this value does not affect cluster size and cannot currently be mutated over the lifetime of a cluster.
  
   * - `instance_profile_arn`
     - String
     - Nodes for this cluster will only be placed on AWS instances with this instance profile. If ommitted, nodes will be placed on instances without an IAM instance profile. The instance profile must have previously been added to the Databricks environment by an account administrator.  This feature may only be available to certain customer plans.  If this field is ommitted, we will pull in the default from the conf if it exists.
  
   * - `spot_bid_price_percent`
     - Integer
     - The bid price for AWS spot instances, as a percentage of the corresponding instance type's on-demand price. For example, if this field is set to 50, and the cluster needs a new `r3.xlarge` spot instance, then the bid price is half of the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. Similarly, if this field is set to 200, the bid price is twice the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. If not specified, the default value is 100. When spot instances are requested for this cluster, only spot instances whose bid price percentage matches this field will be considered. Note that, for safety, we enforce this field to be no more than 10000.  The default value and documentation here should be kept consistent with CommonConf.defaultSpotBidPricePercent and CommonConf.maxSpotBidPricePercent.
  
   * - `zone_id`
     - String
     - Identifier for the availability zone/datacenter in which the cluster resides. This string will be of a form like "us-west-2a". The provided availability zone must be in the same region as the Databricks deployment. For example, "us-west-2a" is not a valid zone id if the Databricks deployment resides in the "us-east-1" region. This is an optional field at cluster creation, and if not specified, a default zone will be used. If the zone specified is "auto", will try to place cluster in a zone with high availability, and will retry placement in a different AZ if there is not enough capacity. The list of available zones as well as the default value can be found by using the `List Zones` method.

   * - `first_on_demand`
     - Integer
     - The first `first_on_demand` nodes of the cluster will be placed on on-demand instances. This value should be greater than 0, to make sure the cluster driver node is placed on an on-demand instance. If this value is greater than or equal to the current cluster size, all nodes will be placed on on-demand instances. If this value is less than the current cluster size, `first_on_demand` nodes will be placed on on-demand instances and the remainder will be placed on `availability` instances. Note that this value does not affect cluster size and cannot currently be mutated over the lifetime of a cluster.

Most programming languages, cluster features and data governance features are available in this mode. * `USER_ISOLATION`: A secure cluster that can be shared by multiple users. Cluster users are fully isolated so that they cannot see each other's data and credentials. Most data governance features are supported in this mode. But programming languages and cluster features might be limited.  The following modes are deprecated starting with Databricks Runtime 15.0 and will be removed for future Databricks Runtime versions:  * `LEGACY_TABLE_ACL`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Table ACL clusters. * `LEGACY_PASSTHROUGH`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on high concurrency clusters. * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Passthrough on standard clusters. * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER_STANDARD`: This mode provides a way that doesn’t have UC nor passthrough enabled. 
  
   * - `docker_image`
     - Map
     - See [_](#jobsnametasksnew_clusterdocker_image).
  
   * - `driver_instance_pool_id`
     - String
     - The optional ID of the instance pool for the driver of the cluster belongs. The pool cluster uses the instance pool with id (instance_pool_id) if the driver pool is not assigned.
  
   * - `driver_node_type_id`
     - String
     - The node type of the Spark driver. Note that this field is optional; if unset, the driver node type will be set as the same value as `node_type_id` defined above. 
  
   * - `enable_elastic_disk`
     - Boolean
     - Autoscaling Local Storage: when enabled, this cluster will dynamically acquire additional disk space when its Spark workers are running low on disk space. This feature requires specific AWS permissions to function correctly - refer to the User Guide for more details.
  
   * - `enable_local_disk_encryption`
     - Boolean
     - Whether to enable LUKS on cluster VMs' local disks
  
   * - `gcp_attributes`

   * - `kind`
     - String
     - 
  
   * - `node_type_id`
     - String
     - This field encodes, through a single value, the resources available to each of the Spark nodes in this cluster. For example, the Spark nodes can be provisioned and optimized for memory or compute intensive workloads. A list of available node types can be retrieved by using the :method:clusters/listNodeTypes API call. 
  
   * - `num_workers`
     - Integer
     - Number of worker nodes that this cluster should have. A cluster has one Spark Driver and `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.  Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number of workers rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster is resized from 5 to 10 workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect the target size of 10 workers, whereas the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are provisioned.
  
   * - `policy_id`
     - String
     - The ID of the cluster policy used to create the cluster if applicable.
  
   * - `runtime_engine`

   * - `spark_env_vars`
     - Map
     - An object containing a set of optional, user-specified environment variable key-value pairs. Please note that key-value pair of the form (X,Y) will be exported as is (i.e., `export X='Y'`) while launching the driver and workers.  In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending them to `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all default databricks managed environmental variables are included as well.  Example Spark environment variables: `{"SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY": "28000m", "SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS": "/local_disk0"}` or `{"SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS": "$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS -Dspark.shuffle.service.enabled=true"}`
  
   * - `spark_version`

     - SSH public key contents that will be added to each Spark node in this cluster. The corresponding private keys can be used to login with the user name `ubuntu` on port `2200`. Up to 10 keys can be specified.
  
   * - `use_ml_runtime`
     - Boolean
     - This field can only be used with `kind`.  `effective_spark_version` is determined by `spark_version` (DBR release), this field `use_ml_runtime`, and whether `node_type_id` is gpu node or not. 
  
   * - `workload_type`
     - Map
     - See [_](#jobsnametasksnew_clusterworkload_type).

   :header-rows: 1
  
   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - `availability`
     - String
     - Availability type used for all subsequent nodes past the `first_on_demand` ones.  Note: If `first_on_demand` is zero, this availability type will be used for the entire cluster. 
  
   * - `ebs_volume_count`
     - Integer
     - The number of volumes launched for each instance. Users can choose up to 10 volumes. This feature is only enabled for supported node types. Legacy node types cannot specify custom EBS volumes. For node types with no instance store, at least one EBS volume needs to be specified; otherwise, cluster creation will fail.  These EBS volumes will be mounted at `/ebs0`, `/ebs1`, and etc. Instance store volumes will be mounted at `/local_disk0`, `/local_disk1`, and etc.  If EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use only the EBS volumes for scratch storage because heterogenously sized scratch devices can lead to inefficient disk utilization. If no EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use instance store volumes.  Please note that if EBS volumes are specified, then the Spark configuration `spark.local.dir` will be overridden.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_iops`
     - Integer
     - If using gp3 volumes, what IOPS to use for the disk. If this is not set, the maximum performance of a gp2 volume with the same volume size will be used.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_size`
     - Integer
     - The size of each EBS volume (in GiB) launched for each instance. For general purpose SSD, this value must be within the range 100 - 4096. For throughput optimized HDD, this value must be within the range 500 - 4096.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_throughput`
     - Integer
     - If using gp3 volumes, what throughput to use for the disk. If this is not set, the maximum performance of a gp2 volume with the same volume size will be used.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_type`
     - String
     - The type of EBS volumes that will be launched with this cluster.
  
   * - `first_on_demand`
     - Integer
     - The first `first_on_demand` nodes of the cluster will be placed on on-demand instances. If this value is greater than 0, the cluster driver node in particular will be placed on an on-demand instance. If this value is greater than or equal to the current cluster size, all nodes will be placed on on-demand instances. If this value is less than the current cluster size, `first_on_demand` nodes will be placed on on-demand instances and the remainder will be placed on `availability` instances. Note that this value does not affect cluster size and cannot currently be mutated over the lifetime of a cluster.
  
   * - `instance_profile_arn`
     - String
     - Nodes for this cluster will only be placed on AWS instances with this instance profile. If ommitted, nodes will be placed on instances without an IAM instance profile. The instance profile must have previously been added to the Databricks environment by an account administrator.  This feature may only be available to certain customer plans.  If this field is ommitted, we will pull in the default from the conf if it exists.
  
   * - `spot_bid_price_percent`
     - Integer
     - The bid price for AWS spot instances, as a percentage of the corresponding instance type's on-demand price. For example, if this field is set to 50, and the cluster needs a new `r3.xlarge` spot instance, then the bid price is half of the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. Similarly, if this field is set to 200, the bid price is twice the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. If not specified, the default value is 100. When spot instances are requested for this cluster, only spot instances whose bid price percentage matches this field will be considered. Note that, for safety, we enforce this field to be no more than 10000.  The default value and documentation here should be kept consistent with CommonConf.defaultSpotBidPricePercent and CommonConf.maxSpotBidPricePercent.
  
   * - `zone_id`
     - String
     - Identifier for the availability zone/datacenter in which the cluster resides. This string will be of a form like "us-west-2a". The provided availability zone must be in the same region as the Databricks deployment. For example, "us-west-2a" is not a valid zone id if the Databricks deployment resides in the "us-east-1" region. This is an optional field at cluster creation, and if not specified, a default zone will be used. If the zone specified is "auto", will try to place cluster in a zone with high availability, and will retry placement in a different AZ if there is not enough capacity. The list of available zones as well as the default value can be found by using the `List Zones` method.

   * - `first_on_demand`
     - Integer
     - The first `first_on_demand` nodes of the cluster will be placed on on-demand instances. This value should be greater than 0, to make sure the cluster driver node is placed on an on-demand instance. If this value is greater than or equal to the current cluster size, all nodes will be placed on on-demand instances. If this value is less than the current cluster size, `first_on_demand` nodes will be placed on on-demand instances and the remainder will be placed on `availability` instances. Note that this value does not affect cluster size and cannot currently be mutated over the lifetime of a cluster.

### jobs.\<name\>.tasks.spark_submit_task
  
**`Type: Map`**
  
(Legacy) The task runs the spark-submit script when the `spark_submit_task` field is present. This task can run only on new clusters and is not compatible with serverless compute.

In the `new_cluster` specification, `libraries` and `spark_conf` are not supported. Instead, use `--jars` and `--py-files` to add Java and Python libraries and `--conf` to set the Spark configurations.

`master`, `deploy-mode`, and `executor-cores` are automatically configured by Databricks; you _cannot_ specify them in parameters.

By default, the Spark submit job uses all available memory (excluding reserved memory for Databricks services). You can set `--driver-memory`, and `--executor-memory` to a smaller value to leave some room for off-heap usage.

The `--jars`, `--py-files`, `--files` arguments support DBFS and S3 paths.

In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending them to `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all default databricks managed environmental variables are included as well.  Example Spark environment variables: `{"SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY": "28000m", "SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS": "/local_disk0"}` or `{"SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS": "$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS -Dspark.shuffle.service.enabled=true"}`

     - String
     - Availability type used for all subsequent nodes past the `first_on_demand` ones.  Note: If `first_on_demand` is zero, this availability type will be used for the entire cluster. 
  
   * - `ebs_volume_count`
     - Integer
     - The number of volumes launched for each instance. Users can choose up to 10 volumes. This feature is only enabled for supported node types. Legacy node types cannot specify custom EBS volumes. For node types with no instance store, at least one EBS volume needs to be specified; otherwise, cluster creation will fail.  These EBS volumes will be mounted at `/ebs0`, `/ebs1`, and etc. Instance store volumes will be mounted at `/local_disk0`, `/local_disk1`, and etc.  If EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use only the EBS volumes for scratch storage because heterogenously sized scratch devices can lead to inefficient disk utilization. If no EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use instance store volumes.  Please note that if EBS volumes are specified, then the Spark configuration `spark.local.dir` will be overridden.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_iops`
     - Integer
     - If using gp3 volumes, what IOPS to use for the disk. If this is not set, the maximum performance of a gp2 volume with the same volume size will be used.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_size`
     - Integer
     - The size of each EBS volume (in GiB) launched for each instance. For general purpose SSD, this value must be within the range 100 - 4096. For throughput optimized HDD, this value must be within the range 500 - 4096.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_throughput`
     - Integer
     - If using gp3 volumes, what throughput to use for the disk. If this is not set, the maximum performance of a gp2 volume with the same volume size will be used.
  
   * - `ebs_volume_type`
     - String
     - The type of EBS volumes that will be launched with this cluster.
  
   * - `first_on_demand`
     - Integer
     - The first `first_on_demand` nodes of the cluster will be placed on on-demand instances. If this value is greater than 0, the cluster driver node in particular will be placed on an on-demand instance. If this value is greater than or equal to the current cluster size, all nodes will be placed on on-demand instances. If this value is less than the current cluster size, `first_on_demand` nodes will be placed on on-demand instances and the remainder will be placed on `availability` instances. Note that this value does not affect cluster size and cannot currently be mutated over the lifetime of a cluster.
  
   * - `instance_profile_arn`
     - String
     - Nodes for this cluster will only be placed on AWS instances with this instance profile. If ommitted, nodes will be placed on instances without an IAM instance profile. The instance profile must have previously been added to the Databricks environment by an account administrator.  This feature may only be available to certain customer plans.  If this field is ommitted, we will pull in the default from the conf if it exists.
  
   * - `spot_bid_price_percent`
     - Integer
     - The bid price for AWS spot instances, as a percentage of the corresponding instance type's on-demand price. For example, if this field is set to 50, and the cluster needs a new `r3.xlarge` spot instance, then the bid price is half of the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. Similarly, if this field is set to 200, the bid price is twice the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. If not specified, the default value is 100. When spot instances are requested for this cluster, only spot instances whose bid price percentage matches this field will be considered. Note that, for safety, we enforce this field to be no more than 10000.  The default value and documentation here should be kept consistent with CommonConf.defaultSpotBidPricePercent and CommonConf.maxSpotBidPricePercent.
  
   * - `zone_id`
     - String
     - Identifier for the availability zone/datacenter in which the cluster resides. This string will be of a form like "us-west-2a". The provided availability zone must be in the same region as the Databricks deployment. For example, "us-west-2a" is not a valid zone id if the Databricks deployment resides in the "us-east-1" region. This is an optional field at cluster creation, and if not specified, a default zone will be used. If the zone specified is "auto", will try to place cluster in a zone with high availability, and will retry placement in a different AZ if there is not enough capacity. The list of available zones as well as the default value can be found by using the `List Zones` method.

**`Type: Map`**
  
The registered model resource allows you to define models in <UC>. For information about <UC> [registered models](/api/workspace/registeredmodels/create), see [_](/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/index.md).
  
```yaml
registered_models:
  <registered_model-name>:
    <registered_model-field-name>: <registered_model-field-value>
```
  
  
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
  
   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - `catalog_name`
     - String
     - The name of the catalog where the schema and the registered model reside
  
   * - `comment`
     - String
     - The comment attached to the registered model
  
   * - `grants`
     - Sequence
     - See [_](#registered_modelsnamegrants).
  
   * - `name`
     - String
     - The name of the registered model
  
   * - `schema_name`
     - String
     - The name of the schema where the registered model resides
  
   * - `storage_location`
     - String
     - The storage location on the cloud under which model version data files are stored
  
  
**Example**
  
The following example defines a registered model in <UC>:

```yaml
resources:
  registered_models:
      model:
        name: my_model
        catalog_name: ${bundle.target}
        schema_name: mlops_schema
        comment: Registered model in Unity Catalog for ${bundle.target} deployment target
        grants:
          - privileges:
              - EXECUTE
            principal: account users
```
  
### registered_models.\<name\>.grants

   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - `principal`
     - String
     - The name of the principal that will be granted privileges
  
   * - `privileges`
     - Sequence
     - The privileges to grant to the specified entity
  
  
## schemas
  
**`Type: Map`**
  
The schema resource type allows you to define <UC> [schemas](/api/workspace/schemas/create) for tables and other assets in your workflows and pipelines created as part of a bundle. A schema, different from other resource types, has the following limitations:

- The owner of a schema resource is always the deployment user, and cannot be changed. If `run_as` is specified in the bundle, it will be ignored by operations on the schema.
- Only fields supported by the corresponding [Schemas object create API](/api/workspace/schemas/create) are available for the schema resource. For example, `enable_predictive_optimization` is not supported as it is only available on the [update API](/api/workspace/schemas/update).
  
```yaml
schemas:
  <schema-name>:
    <schema-field-name>: <schema-field-value>
```
  
  
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
  
   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - `catalog_name`
     - String
     - Name of parent catalog.
  
   * - `comment`
     - String
     - User-provided free-form text description.
  
   * - `grants`
     - Sequence
     - See [_](#schemasnamegrants).
  
   * - `name`
     - String
     - Name of schema, relative to parent catalog.
  
   * - `properties`
     - Map
     - 
  
   * - `storage_root`
     - String
     - Storage root URL for managed tables within schema.
  
  
**Example**
  
The following example defines a pipeline with the resource key `my_pipeline` that creates a <UC> schema with the key `my_schema` as the target:

```yaml
resources:
  pipelines:
    my_pipeline:
      name: test-pipeline-{{.unique_id}}
      libraries:
        - notebook:
            path: ./nb.sql
      development: true
      catalog: main
      target: ${resources.schemas.my_schema.id}

  schemas:
    my_schema:
      name: test-schema-{{.unique_id}}
      catalog_name: main
      comment: This schema was created by DABs.
```

A top-level grants mapping is not supported by <DABS>, so if you want to set grants for a schema, define the grants for the schema within the `schemas` mapping. For more information about grants, see [_](/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/index.md#grant).

The following example defines a <UC> schema with grants:

```yaml
resources:
  schemas:
    my_schema:
      name: test-schema
      grants:
        - principal: users
          privileges:
            - CAN_MANAGE
        - principal: my_team
          privileges:
            - CAN_READ
      catalog_name: main
  ```
  
### schemas.\<name\>.grants
  
**`Type: Sequence`**
  

  
  
  
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
  
   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - `principal`
     - String
     - The name of the principal that will be granted privileges
  
   * - `privileges`
     - Sequence
     - The privileges to grant to the specified entity
  
  
## volumes
  
**`Type: Map`**
  
The volume resource type allows you to define and create <UC> [volumes](/api/workspace/volumes/create) as part of a bundle. When deploying a bundle with a volume defined, note that:

- A volume cannot be referenced in the `artifact_path` for the bundle until it exists in the workspace. Hence, if you want to use <DABS> to create the volume, you must first define the volume in the bundle, deploy it to create the volume, then reference it in the `artifact_path` in subsequent deployments.

- Volumes in the bundle are not prepended with the `dev_${workspace.current_user.short_name}` prefix when the deployment target has `mode: development` configured. However, you can manually configure this prefix. See [_](/dev-tools/bundles/deployment-modes.md#custom-presets).
  
```yaml
volumes:
  <volume-name>:
    <volume-field-name>: <volume-field-value>
```
  
  
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
  
   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - `catalog_name`
     - String
     - The name of the catalog where the schema and the volume are
  
   * - `comment`
     - String
     - The comment attached to the volume
  
   * - `grants`
     - Sequence
     - See [_](#volumesnamegrants).
  
   * - `name`
     - String
     - The name of the volume
  
   * - `schema_name`
     - String
     - The name of the schema where the volume is
  
   * - `storage_location`
     - String
     - The storage location on the cloud
  
   * - `volume_type`
     - String
     - 
  
  
**Example**
  
The following example creates a <UC> volume with the key `my_volume`:

```yaml
resources:
  volumes:
    my_volume:
      catalog_name: main
      name: my_volume
      schema_name: my_schema
```

For an example bundle that runs a job that writes to a file in <UC> volume, see the [bundle-examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/databricks/bundle-examples/tree/main/knowledge_base/write_from_job_to_volume).
