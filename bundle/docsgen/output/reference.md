# Configuration reference

This article provides reference for keys supported by :re[DABS] configuration (YAML). See [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/index.md).

For complete bundle examples, see [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/resource-examples.md) and the [bundle-examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/databricks/bundle-examples).

  
## artifacts

Defines the attributes to build artifacts, where each key is the name of the artifact, and the value is a Map that defines the artifact build settings. For information about the `artifacts` mapping, see [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/settings.md#artifacts).

Artifact settings defined in the top level of the bundle configuration can be overridden in the `targets` mapping. See [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/artifact-overrides.md).
