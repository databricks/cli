  # Statuses and checks apply to specific commits (by hash).
  # Enforcement of required checks is done both at the PR level and the merge queue level.
  # In case of multiple commits in a single PR, the hash of the squashed commit
  # will not match the one for the latest (approved) commit in the PR.
  #
  # We auto approve the check for the merge queue for two reasons:
  #
  #   * Queue times out due to duration of tests.
  #   * Avoid running integration tests twice, since it was already run at the tip of the branch before squashing.
