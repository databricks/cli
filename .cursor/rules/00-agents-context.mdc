Always apply AGENTS context before taking actions.

1. If `/AGENTS.md` exists, read and follow it for every task in this workspace.
2. When working in a subdirectory, check for a closer `AGENTS.md` in that path and follow it as an override.
3. If multiple `AGENTS.md` files apply and conflict, the most specific (closest) one wins.
4. Keep these instructions active even for small or routine requests.
